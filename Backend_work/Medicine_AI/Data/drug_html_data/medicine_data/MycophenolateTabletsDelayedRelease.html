</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Mycophenolate Tablets Delayed Release</h2><h3>Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Kidney Transplant</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving a kidney transplant.</p><p>Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older who are at least 6 months post kidney transplant.</p><p>Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are to be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) tablets and capsules should not be used interchangeably without physician supervision because the rate of absorption following the administration of these two products is not equivalent.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Tablets Delayed Release Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets is 720 mg administered twice daily (1440 mg total daily dose).</p><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Kidney Transplant Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in conversion (at least 6 months post-transplant) pediatric patients age 5 years and older is 400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area (BSA) administered twice daily (up to a maximum dose of 720 mg administered twice daily).</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be taken on an empty stomach, one hour before or 2 hours after food intake <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should not be crushed, chewed, or cut prior to ingesting. The tablets should be swallowed whole in order to maintain the integrity of the enteric coating.</p><p>Pediatric patients with a BSA of 1.19 to 1.58 m<span class="Sup">2</span> may be dosed either with three mycophenolic acid delayed-release 180 mg tablets, or one 180 mg tablet plus one 360 mg tablet twice daily (1080 mg daily dose). Patients with a BSA of &gt; 1.58 m<span class="Sup">2</span> may be dosed either with four mycophenolic acid delayed-release 180 mg tablets, or two mycophenolic acid delayed-release 360 mg tablets twice daily (1440 mg daily dose). Pediatric doses for patients with BSA &lt; 1.19 m<span class="Sup">2</span> cannot be accurately administered using currently available formulations of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are available as 180 mg and 360 mg tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage Strength</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">180 mg tablet</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">360 mg tablet</span></p><p class="First">Active ingredient</p><p class="First">mycophenolic acid as mycophenolate sodium</p><p class="First">mycophenolic acid as mycophenolate sodium</p><p class="First">Appearance</p><p class="First">sage green, film-coated, round tablet</p><p class="First">reddish-orange, film-coated, modified capsule shaped tablet</p><p class="First">Imprint</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">M</span> over <span class="Bold">MC1</span> on one side of the tablet and blank on the other side</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">M MC2</span> on one side of the tablet and blank on the other side</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate sodium, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, or to any of its excipients. Reactions like rash, pruritus, hypotension, and chest pain have been observed in clinical trials and post-marketing reports <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryofetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning</h3><p class="First">Females of reproductive potential must be aware of the increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. For recommended pregnancy testing and contraception methods <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Management of Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning].</span></p><h3>Lymphoma and Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.</p><p>As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</p><p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children.</p><h3>Serious Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections including opportunistic infections <span class="Italics">[Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.</p><h3>New or Reactivated Viral Infections</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, reactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including the mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivatives mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and MMF. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of new or reactivated viral infections. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.</span></p><p>PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)<span class="following_xmChange">]</span></span><span class="following_xmChange">.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended.</span></p><h3>Blood Dyscrasias Including Pure Red Cell Aplasia</h3><p class="First">Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with MPA derivatives in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. The mechanism for MPA derivatives induced PRCA is unknown; the relative contribution of other immunosuppressants and their combinations in an immunosuppressive regimen is also unknown. In some cases PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of therapy with MPA derivatives. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. Changes to mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimize the risk of graft rejection.</p><p>Patients receiving mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be monitored for blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia). The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these reactions. Complete blood count should be performed weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and the third month of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If blood dyscrasias occur [neutropenia develops (ANC &lt; 1.3×10<span class="Sup">3</span>/mcL) or anemia], dosing with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate tests performed, and the patient managed accordingly.</p><h3>Serious GI Tract Complications</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospitalization), intestinal perforations, gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.</p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets; examples include (but not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.</p><h3>Rare Hereditary Deficiencies</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (IMPDH Inhibitor). Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including renal failure.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label.</p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below derive from two randomized, comparative, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy trials in prevention of acute rejection in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> and converted stable kidney transplant patients.</p><p>In the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> trial, patients were administered either mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 1.44 grams per day (n = 213) or MMF 2 grams per day (n = 210) within 48 hours post-transplant for 12 months in combination with cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED and corticosteroids. Forty-one percent of patients also received antibody therapy as induction treatment. In the conversion trial, renal transplant patients who were at least 6 months post-transplant and receiving 2 grams per day MMF in combination with cyclosporine USP MODIFIED, with or without corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to entry in the trial were randomized to mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 1.44 grams per day (n = 159) or MMF 2 grams per day (n = 163) for 12 months.</p><p>The average age of patients in both studies was 47 years and 48 years (<span class="Italics">de novo</span> study and conversion study, respectively), ranging from 22 to 75 years. Approximately 66% of patients were male; 82% were white, 12% were black, and 6% other races. About 40% of patients were from the United States and 60% from other countries.</p><p>In the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> trial, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 18% (39/213) and 17% (35/210) in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and MMF arms, respectively.The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets arm were graft loss (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (1%), renal impairment (1%), CMV infection (1%), and leukopenia (1%). The overall incidence of patients reporting dose reduction at least once during the 0 to 12 month study period was 59% and 60% in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and MMF arms, respectively. The most frequent reasons for dose reduction in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets arm were adverse reactions (44%), dose reductions according to protocol guidelines (17%), dosing errors (11%) and missing data (2%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) associated with the administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets were anemia, leukopenia, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection, insomnia and postoperative pain.</p><p>The adverse reactions reported in ≥ 10% of patients in the <span

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets: agranulocytosis, asthenia, osteomyelitis, lymphadenopathy, lymphopenia, wheezing, dry mouth, gastritis, peritonitis, anorexia, alopecia, pulmonary edema, Kaposi’s sarcoma<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">.</span></span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids decreased plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids not be administered simultaneously <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Azathioprine</h3><p class="First">Given that azathioprine and MMF inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or MMF.</p><h3>Cholestyramine, Bile Acid Sequestrates, Oral Activated Charcoal and Other Drugs that Interfere with Enterohepatic Recirculation</h3><p class="First">Drugs that interrupt enterohepatic recirculation may decrease MPA plasma concentrations when coadministered with MMF. Therefore, do not administer mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, e.g., bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Sevelamer</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of sevelamer and MMF may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and therefore, MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are coadministered with cyclosporine. Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential change of MPA plasma concentrations after switching from cyclosporine to other immunosuppressive drugs or from other immunosuppressive drugs to cyclosporine in patients concomitantly receiving mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Norfloxacin and Metronidazole</h3><p class="First">MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when MMF is administrated with norfloxacin and metronidazole. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. Although there will be no effect on MPA plasma concentrations when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole when given separately <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Rifampin</h3><p class="First">The concomitant administration of MMF and rifampin may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hormonal Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">In a drug interaction study, mean levonorgestrel AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with MMF. Although mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives, it is recommended to coadminister mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6),</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Acyclovir (Valacyclovir), Ganciclovir (Valganciclovir), and Other Drugs that Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion</h3><p class="First">The coadministration of MMF and acyclovir or ganciclovir may increase plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir as their coexistence competes for tubular secretion. Both acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir and MPAG concentrations will be also increased in the presence of renal impairment.

Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets is concomitantly administered with ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear; however, no dose adjustment of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets is needed when coadministered with these drugs <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Pantoprazole</h3><p class="First">Administration of a pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg twice daily for 4 days to healthy volunteers did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]</span></p><p>For those females using mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets at any time during pregnancy and those becoming pregnant within 6 weeks of discontinuing therapy, the healthcare practitioner should report the pregnancy to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry (1-800-617-8191). The healthcare practitioner should strongly encourage the patient to enroll in the pregnancy registry. The information provided to the registry will help the Health Care Community to better understand the effects of mycophenolate in pregnancy.</p><p class="First">Following oral or intravenous (IV) administration, MMF is metabolized to mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active ingredient in mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and the active form of the drug. Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney. In animal studies, congenital malformations and pregnancy loss occurred when pregnant rats and rabbits received mycophenolic acid at dose multiples similar to and less than clinical doses.</p><p>Risks and benefits of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be discussed with the patient. When appropriate, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity. In certain situations, the patient and her healthcare practitioner may decide that the maternal benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>In the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR), there were data on 33 MMF-exposed pregnancies in 24 transplant patients; there were 15 spontaneous abortions (45%) and 18 live-born infants. Four of these 18 infants had structural malformations (22%). In post-marketing data (collected from 1995 to 2007) on 77 women exposed to systemic MMF during pregnancy, 25 had spontaneous abortions and 14 had a malformed infant or fetus. Six of 14 malformed offspring had ear abnormalities. Because these post-marketing data are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of particular adverse outcomes. These malformations are similar to findings in animal reproductive toxicology studies. For comparison, the background rate for congenital anomalies in the United States is about 3%, and NTPR data show a rate of 4% to 5% among babies born to organ transplant patients using other immunosuppressive drugs. There are no relevant qualitative or quantitative differences in the teratogenic potential of mycophenolate sodium and MMF.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In a teratology study performed with mycophenolate sodium in rats, at a dose as low as 1 mg per kg, malformations in the offspring were observed, including anophthalmia, exencephaly, and umbilical hernia. The systemic exposure at this dose represents 0.05 times the clinical exposure at the dose of 1440 mg per day mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. In teratology studies in rabbits, fetal resorptions and malformations occurred at doses equal to or greater than 80 mg per kg per day, in the absence of maternal toxicity (which corresponds to about 1.1 times the recommended clinical dose, based on body surface area).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether MPA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets have been established in pediatric kidney transplant patients 5 to 16 years of age who were initiated on mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets at least 6 months post-transplant. Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in a similar population of adult kidney transplant patients with additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric kidney transplant patients <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)</span>, <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Pediatric doses for patients with BSA &lt; 1.19 m<span class="Sup">2</span> cannot be accurately administered using currently available formulations of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> pediatric kidney transplant patients and in pediatric kidney transplant patients below the age of 5 years have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 372 patients treated with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in the clinical trials, 6 % (n = 21) were 65 years of age and older and 0.3 % (n = 1) were 75 years of age and older. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Females of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning.</p><p>Females of reproductive potential include girls who have entered puberty and all women who have a uterus and have not passed through menopause. Menopause is the permanent end of menstruation and fertility. Menopause should be clinically confirmed by a patient’s healthcare practitioner. Some commonly used diagnostic criteria include 1) 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (not amenorrhea induced by a medical condition or medical therapy), or 2) postsurgical from a bilateral oophorectomy.</p><p class="First">To prevent unplanned exposure during pregnancy, females of reproductive potential should have a serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL immediately before starting mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Another pregnancy test with the same sensitivity should be done 8 to 10 days later. Repeat pregnancy tests should be performed during routine follow-up visits. Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient.</p><p>In the event of a positive pregnancy test, females should be counseled with regard to whether the maternal benefits of mycophenolate treatment may outweigh the risks to the fetus in certain situations.</p><p class="First">Females of reproductive potential taking mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets must receive contraceptive counseling and use acceptable contraception (see Table 5 for Acceptable Contraception Methods). Patients must use acceptable birth control during entire mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets therapy, and for 6 weeks after stopping mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, unless the patient chooses abstinence (she chooses to avoid heterosexual intercourse completely).</p><p>Patients should be aware that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets reduces blood levels of the hormones in the oral contraceptive pill and could theoretically reduce its effectiveness <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>, <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.8)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5.

Accordingly an overdose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and may increase the susceptibility to infection including opportunistic infections, fatal infections and sepsis. If blood dyscrasias occur (e.g., neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/mcL or anemia), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets.</p><p>Possible signs and symptoms of acute overdose could include the following: hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia and neutropenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and dyspepsia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Treatment and Management</span></span></p><p>General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Although dialysis may be used to remove the inactive metabolite mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), it would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of the active moiety, mycophenolic acid, due to the 98% plasma protein binding of mycophenolic acid. By interfering with enterohepatic circulation of mycophenolic acid, activated charcoal or bile sequestrates, such as cholestyramine, may reduce the systemic mycophenolic acid exposure.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Tablets Delayed Release Description</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are an enteric formulation of mycophenolate sodium that delivers the active moiety mycophenolic acid (MPA). Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressive agent. As the sodium salt, MPA is chemically designated as Sodium 4(E)-6-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxy-7-methyl-3-oxo-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yl)-4-methylhex-4-enoate.</p><p>Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>Na. The molecular weight is 342.32 and the structural formula is:</p><p>Mycophenolic acid, as the sodium salt, is a white to off-white, crystalline powder and is highly soluble in aqueous media at physiological pH and practically insoluble in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid.</p><p>Mycophenolic acid is available for oral use as delayed-release tablets containing either 180 mg or 360 mg of mycophenolic acid.</p><p>Inactive ingredients include colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 Aluminum Lake, hypromellose, hypromellose acetate succinate, magnesium stearate, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, pregelatinized starch (corn), propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide and triethyl citrate. In addition, the 180 mg strength contains yellow iron oxide and the 360 mg strength contains FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake.</p><p>The black imprinting ink contains the following: black iron oxide, hypromellose and propylene glycol.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Tablets Delayed Release - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant, is an uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation to DNA. T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on <span class="Italics">de novo</span> synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways. MPA has cytostatic effects on lymphocytes.</p><p>Mycophenolate sodium has been shown to prevent the occurrence of acute rejection in rat models of kidney and heart allotransplantation. Mycophenolate sodium also decreases antibody production in mice.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets exhibit linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose-range (360 mg to 2160 mg) evaluated. The absolute bioavailability of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporine was 72%. MPA is highly protein bound (&gt; 98% bound to albumin). The predominant metabolite of MPA is the phenolic glucuronide (MPAG) which is pharmacologically inactive. A minor metabolite AcMPAG which is an acyl glucuronide of MPAG is also formed and has pharmacological activity comparable to MPA. MPAG undergoes renal elimination. A fraction of MPAG also undergoes biliary excretion, followed by deconjugation by gut flora and subsequent reabsorption as MPA. The mean elimination half-lives of MPA and MPAG ranged between 8 and 16 hours, and 13 and 17 hours, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that the enteric-coated mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet does not release MPA under acidic conditions (pH &lt; 5) as in the stomach but is highly soluble in neutral pH conditions as in the intestine. Following mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets oral administration without food in several pharmacokinetic studies conducted in renal transplant patients, consistent with its enteric-coated formulation, the median delay (T<span class="Sub">lag</span>) in the rise of MPA concentration ranged between 0.25 and 1.25 hours and the median time to maximum concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of MPA ranged between 1.5 and 2.75 hours. In comparison, following the administration of MMF, the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> ranged between 0.5 and one hour. In stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED based immunosuppression, gastrointestinal absorption and absolute bioavailability of MPA following the administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet was 93% and 72%, respectively. Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets pharmacokinetics is dose proportional over the dose range of 360 mg to 2160 mg.</p><p class="First">The mean (± SD) volume of distribution at steady state and elimination phase for MPA is 54 (± 25) L and 112 (± 48) L, respectively. MPA is highly protein bound to albumin, &gt; 98%. The protein binding of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) is 82%. The free MPA concentration may increase under conditions of decreased protein binding (uremia, hepatic failure, and hypoalbuminemia).</p><p class="First">MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to glucuronidated metabolites. The phenolic glucuronide of MPA, mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), is the predominant metabolite of MPA and does not manifest pharmacological activity. The acyl glucuronide is a minor metabolite and has comparable pharmacological activity to MPA. In stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED based immunosuppression, approximately 28% of the oral mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet dose was converted to MPAG by presystemic metabolism. The AUC ratio of MPA:MPAG:acyl glucuronide is approximately 1:24:0.28 at steady state. The mean clearance of MPA was 140 (± 30) mL/min.</p><p class="First">The majority of MPA dose administered is eliminated in the urine primarily as MPAG (&gt; 60%) and approximately 3% as unchanged MPA following mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet administration to stable renal transplant patients. The mean renal clearance of MPAG was 15.5 (± 5.9) mL/min. MPAG is also secreted in the bile and available for deconjugation by gut flora. MPA resulting from the deconjugation may then be reabsorbed and produce a second peak of MPA approximately 6 to 8 hours after mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet dosing. The mean elimination half-life of MPA and MPAG ranged between 8 and 16 hours, and 13 and 17 hours, respectively.</p><p class="First">Compared to the fasting state, administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 720 mg with a high fat meal (55 g fat, 1000 calories) had no effect on the systemic exposure (AUC) of MPA. However, there was a 33% decrease in the maximal concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), a 3.5 hour delay in the T<span class="Sub">lag</span> (range, -6 to 18 hours), and 5 hour delay in the T<span class="Sub">max</span> (range, -9 to 20 hours) of MPA. To avoid the variability in MPA absorption between doses, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be taken on an empty stomach <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></p><p class="First">The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for MPA following the administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED based immunosuppression are shown in Table 6. Single-dose mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet pharmacokinetics predicts multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. However, in the early post-transplant period, mean MPA AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were approximately one-half of those measured 6 months post-transplant.</p><p>After near equimolar dosing of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 720 mg twice daily and MMF 1000 mg twice daily (739 mg as MPA) in both the single- and multiple-dose cross-over trials, mean systemic MPA exposure (AUC) was similar.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patient</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolic Acid</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dosing</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose (mg)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T<span class="Sub">max</span></span>*</p><p><span class="Bold">(hr)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">max</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(mcg/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC<span class="Sub">0-12hr</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(mcg</span>*<span class="Bold">hr/mL)</span></p><p class="First">Adult</p><p class="First">Single</p><p class="First">24</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">2 (0.8 to 8)</p><p class="First">26.1 ± 12</p><p class="First">66.5 ± 22.6†</p><p class="First">Pediatric‡</p><p class="First">Single</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">450/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">2.5 (1.5 to 24)</p><p class="First">36.3 ± 20.9</p><p class="First">74.3 ± 22.5†</p><p class="First">Adult</p><p class="First">Multiple x 6 days, twice daily</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">2 (1.5 to 3)</p><p class="First">37 ± 13.3</p><p class="First">67.9 ± 20.3</p><p class="First">Adult</p><p class="First">Multiple x 28 days, twice daily</p><p class="First">36</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">2.5 (1.5 to 8)</p><p class="First">31.2 ± 18.1</p><p class="First">71.2 ± 26.3</p><p class="First">Adult</p><p class="First">Chonic, multiple dose, twice daily</p><p class="First">2 weeks post-transplant</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">1.8 (1 to 5.3)</p><p class="First">15 ± 10.7</p><p class="First">28.6 ± 11.5</p><p class="First">3 months post-transplant</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">2 (0.5 to 2.5)</p><p class="First">26.2 ± 12.7</p><p class="First">52.3 ± 17.4</p><p class="First">6 months post-transplant</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">2 (0 to 3)</p><p class="First">24.1 ± 9.6</p><p class="First">57.2 ± 15.3</p><p class="First">Adult</p><p class="First">Chronic, multiple dose, twice daily</p><p class="First">18</p><p class="First">720</p><p class="First">1.5 (0 to 6)</p><p class="First">18.9 ± 7.9</p><p class="First">57.4 ± 15</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Insufficiency</span></p><p>No specific pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with renal impairment were conducted with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets.

Although dialysis may be used to remove the inactive metabolite MPAG, it would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of the active moiety MPA. This is in large part due to the high plasma protein binding of MPA.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></p><p>No specific pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with hepatic impairment were conducted with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. In a single dose (MMF 1000 mg) trial of 18 volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis and 6 healthy volunteers, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes appeared to be relatively unaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease when the pharmacokinetic parameters of healthy volunteers and alcoholic cirrhosis patients within this trial were compared. However, it should be noted that for unexplained reasons, the healthy volunteers in this trial had about a 50% lower AUC compared to healthy volunteers in other studies, thus making comparison between volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis and healthy volunteers difficult. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend on the particular disease. Hepatic disease, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, with other etiologies may show a different effect.<br/>

<span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p>In a drug-drug interaction trial, mean AUCs were similar for ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, when coadministered with MMF as compared to administration of the oral contraceptives alone <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.8)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Acyclovir</span></p><p>Coadministration of MMF (1 gram) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24h)</span> were increased 10% and 18%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of kidney impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.9)]</span>.<br/>

<span class="Italics">Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid</span></p><p>A total of 64 MMF treated kidney transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg 3 times daily for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (predose) from baseline (MMF alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.10)]</span>.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, mycophenolate sodium was not tumorigenic at daily doses up to 9 mg per kg, the highest dose tested. This dose resulted in approximately 0.6 to 1.2 times the systemic exposure (based on plasma AUC) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended dose of 1440 mg per day. Similar results were observed in a parallel study in rats performed with MMF. In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice, MMF was not tumorigenic at a daily dose level as high as 180 mg per kg (which corresponds to 0.6 times the recommended mycophenolate sodium therapeutic dose, based on body surface area).</p><p>The genotoxic potential of mycophenolate sodium was determined in five assays. Mycophenolate sodium was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma/thymidine kinase assay, the micronucleus test in V79 Chinese hamster cells, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. Mycophenolate sodium was not genotoxic in the bacterial mutation assay (<span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> TA 1535, 97a, 98, 100, and 102) or the chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil generated similar genotoxic activity. The genotoxic activity of mycophenolic acid (MPA) is probably due to the depletion of the nucleotide pool required for DNA synthesis as a result of the pharmacodynamic mode of action of MPA (inhibition of nucleotide synthesis).</p><p>Mycophenolate sodium had no effect on male rat fertility at daily oral doses as high as 18 mg per kg and exhibited no testicular or spermatogenic effects at daily oral doses of 20 mg per kg for 13 weeks (approximately 2 times the systemic exposure of MPA at the recommended therapeutic dose). No effects on female fertility were seen up to a daily dose of 20 mg per kg (approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of MPA at the recommended therapeutic dose).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Patients Receiving Allogeneic Renal Transplants</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in combination with cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED and corticosteroids for the prevention of organ rejection was assessed in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind active-controlled trials in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> and conversion renal transplant patients compared to MMF.</p><p>The <span class="Italics">de novo</span> trial was conducted in 423 renal transplant patients (ages 18 to 75 years) in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Spain, UK, and USA.
