Although rare, hypersensitivity is more frequently seen in individuals with aspirin allergy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Maternal iron requirements increase during pregnancy. Adequate iron concentrations to the fetus can be maintained regardless of maternal iron status, except in severe cases of anemia (IOM 2001). Untreated iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a pregnant female may be associated with adverse events, including low birth weight, preterm birth, or increased perinatal mortality (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2020]; IOM 2001).</p><p>In general, treatment of iron deficiency or IDA in pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant females (USPSTF [Siu 2015]). Ferrous salts are preferred for oral management of IDA in pregnancy (BSH [Pavord 2020]). Iron supplementation is recommended for 3 months once hemoglobin is within the normal range, and for at least 6 months postpartum to replenish maternal iron stores (BSH [Pavord 2020]; FIGO 2019). The majority of studies note iron therapy improves maternal hematologic parameters; however, information related to clinical outcomes in the mother and neonate is limited (FIGO 2019; USPSTF [Siu 2015]). Oral preparations are generally sufficient; however, parenteral iron therapy may be used in females who cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron, in cases of severe iron deficiency, or when malabsorption is present (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2020]). Enteric-coated and slow/sustained-release preparations may be less effective and use should be avoided (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help growth and good health.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent low iron in the body.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
