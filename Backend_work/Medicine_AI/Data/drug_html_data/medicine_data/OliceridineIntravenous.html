Assess each patient's risk before prescribing, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of behaviors or conditions.Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or following a dose increase.Prolonged use of oliceridine during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.Concomitant use of oliceridine with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for oliceridine</h2><p>Oliceridine injection is used to relieve acute pain severe enough to require a narcotic pain medicine and in patients who have been previously treated with other medicines that did not work well.</p><p>Oliceridine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.</p><p>When oliceridine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.</p><p>Oliceridine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using oliceridine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For oliceridine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to oliceridine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oliceridine injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oliceridine injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of oliceridine than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving oliceridine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of oliceridine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol or drug abuse or addiction, history of or</li>
<li>Brain problems (eg, increased pressure, tumors) or</li>
<li>Head injury or</li>

<li>Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Liver disease or</li>
<li>Poor metabolizers of certain enzymes (eg, CYP2D6)—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of oliceridine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you oliceridine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.</p><p>Your doctor may also let you decide when you will get a dose of the pain medicine by pressing a button on a computerized machine pump (patient-controlled analgesia).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using oliceridine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely while you are receiving oliceridine</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Oliceridine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.</p><p><i>Symptoms of an overdose include</i>: extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, or cold, clammy skin. Tell your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.</p><p>Oliceridine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while receiving oliceridine.</p><p>Receiving oliceridine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn babies. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight.</p><p>Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you or anyone in your family has ever had a heart rhythm problem such as QT prolongation.</p><p>Oliceridine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the other medicines listed above while you are receiving oliceridine</i>.</p><p>Oliceridine may cause adrenal gland problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, nausea, depression, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.</p><p>Severe dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Oliceridine may make you dizzy or less alert than you are normally. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how oliceridine affects you</i>.</p><p>If you have been receiving oliceridine regularly for several days, <i>do not suddenly stop receiving it without first checking with your doctor</i>. You or your child may be directed to slowly reduce the amount you are using before stopping treatment completely to lessen the chance of withdrawal side effects (eg, stomach cramps, fever, runny nose, anxiety, or restlessness).</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.</p><p>Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you or your child to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.</p><p>Receiving too much of oliceridine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before receiving oliceridine if you plan to have children.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Oliceridine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
