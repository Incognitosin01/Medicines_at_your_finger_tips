Formoterol is a long-acting bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways to improve breathing.&lt; Mometasone is a corticosteroid. It prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.</p><p>Dulera is used to control and prevent the symptoms of asthma in adults and children who are at least 5 years old.</p><p>Dulera is not for use in treating an asthma or bronchospasm attack.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Dulera is not a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> It will not work fast enough to treat an asthma or bronchospasm attack.</p><p>Formoterol when used alone may increase the risk of death in people with asthma. However, this risk is not increased when formoterol and mometasone are used together as a combination product.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Dulera if you are allergic to formoterol or mometasone.</p><p>Mometasone can weaken your immune system. Tell your doctor about any illness or infection you've had within the past several weeks.</p><p>To make sure Dulera is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

However, having untreated or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy may cause complications such as low birth weight, premature birth, or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating asthma may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine.
