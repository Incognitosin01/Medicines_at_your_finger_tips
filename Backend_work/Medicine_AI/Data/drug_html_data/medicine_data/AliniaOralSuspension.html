</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Alinia Oral Suspension</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Diarrhea caused by <span class="Italics">Giardia lamblia</span> or <span class="Italics">Cryptosporidium parvum:</span></span></p><p>ALINIA for Oral Suspension (patients 1 year of age and older) and ALINIA Tablets (patients 12 years and older) are indicated for the treatment of diarrhea caused by <span class="Italics">Giardia lamblia</span> or <span class="Italics">Cryptosporidium parvum</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>ALINIA for Oral Suspension and ALINIA Tablets have not been shown to be effective for the treatment of diarrhea caused by <span class="Italics">Cryptosporidium parvum</span> in HIV-infected or immunodeficient patients <span class="Italics">[ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span></p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>2.1 Recommended Dosage and Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Important Administration Instructions for Pediatric Patients 11 years of Age or Younger:</span></p><p>ALINIA tablets should not be administered to pediatric patients 11 years of age or younger because a single tablet contains a greater amount of nitazoxanide than the recommended dosing in this pediatric age group.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1. Recommended Dosage</span></p><p class="First">5 mL of ALINIA for Oral suspension</p><p>(100 mg nitazoxanide) taken orally every 12 hours with food</p><p class="First">10 mL of ALINIA for Oral Suspension</p><p>(200 mg nitazoxanide) taken orally every 12 hours with food</p><h3>2.2 Directions for Mixing ALINIA for Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">Reconstitute ALINIA for Oral Suspension as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Measure 48 mL of water for preparation of the 100 mg/5 mL suspension</li>
<li>Tap bottle until all powder flows freely.</li>
<li>Add approximately one-half of the 48 mL of water required for reconstitution and shake vigorously to suspend powder.</li>
<li>Add remainder of water and again shake vigorously</li>
</ul><p>Keep container tightly closed, and shake the suspension well before each administration. The reconstituted suspension may be stored for 7 days at room temperature, after which any unused portion must be discarded.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h3>3.1 ALINIA Tablets (500 mg)</h3><p class="First">Round, yellow, film-coated tablets debossed with ALINIA on one side and 500 on the other side. Each tablet contains 500 mg of nitazoxanide.</p><h3>3.2 ALINIA for Oral Suspension (100 mg/5 mL)</h3><p class="First">Pink-colored powder formulation that, when reconstituted as directed, contains 100 mg nitazoxanide/5 mL. The reconstituted suspension has a pink color and strawberry flavor.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>4.1 Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">ALINIA Tablets and ALINIA for Oral Suspension are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity to nitazoxanide or any other ingredient in the formulations.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of ALINIA was evaluated in 2177 HIV-uninfected subjects 12 months of age and older who received ALINIA Tablets or ALINIA for Oral Suspension at the recommended dose for at least three days. In pooled controlled clinical trials involving 536 HIV-uninfected subjects treated with ALINIA Tablets or ALINIA for Oral Suspension, the most common adverse reactions were abdominal pain, headache, chromaturia and nausea (&gt;2%).</p><p>Safety data were analyzed separately for 280 HIV-uninfected subjects ≥12 years of age receiving ALINIA at the recommended dose for at least three days in 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials and for 256 HIV-uninfected subjects 1 through 11 years of age in 7 controlled clinical trials. There were no differences between the adverse reactions reported for ALINIA-treated subjects based upon age.</p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ALINIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following is a list of adverse reactions spontaneously reported with ALINIA Tablets which were not included in clinical trial listings:</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders:</span> diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System disorders:</span> dizziness</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:</span> dyspnea</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> rash, urticaria</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>7.1 Highly Protein Bound Drugs with Narrow Therapeutic Indices</h3><p class="First">Tizoxanide (the active metabolite of nitazoxanide) is highly bound to plasma protein (&gt;99.9%). Therefore, monitor for adverse reactions when administering nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin).</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data with ALINIA in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. No teratogenicity or fetotoxicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of nitazoxanide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposure 30 and 2 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 500 mg twice daily based on body surface area (BSA).</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Nitazoxanide was administered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 0, 200, 800 or 3200 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 to 15. Nitazoxanide produced no evidence of systemic maternal toxicity when administer once daily via oral gavage to pregnant female rats at levels up to 3200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis <span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>In rabbits, nitazoxanide administered at doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day on gestation days 7 to 20. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with nitazoxanide during organogenesis resulted in minimal maternal toxicity and no external fetal anomalies.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>No information regarding the presence of nitazoxanide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production is available. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ALINIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ALINIA or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension for the treatment of diarrhea caused by <span class="Italics">G. lamblia</span> or <span class="Italics">C. parvum</span> in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age has been established based on three (3) randomized, controlled studies with 104 pediatric subjects treated with ALINIA for Oral Suspension 100 mg/5 mL. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension for the treatment of diarrhea caused by <span class="Italics">G. lamblia</span> or <span class="Italics">C. parvum</span> in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age has been established based on two (2) randomized controlled studies with 44 pediatric subjects treated with ALINIA for Oral Suspension 100 mg/5 mL. <span class="Italics">[ see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span></p><p>The safety and efficacy of ALINIA Tablets for the treatment of diarrhea caused by <span class="Italics">G. lamblia</span> or <span class="Italics">C. parvum</span> in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age has been established based on three (3) randomized controlled studies with 47 pediatric subjects treated with ALINIA Tablets 500 mg.</p><p>A single ALINIA Tablet contains a greater amount of nitazoxanide than is recommended for use in pediatric patients 11 years or younger. <span class="Italics">[ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension in pediatric patients less than one year of age has not been studied.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of ALINIA Tablets and ALINIA for Oral Suspension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing ALINIA Tablets and ALINIA for Oral Suspension.</p><h3>8.6 Renal and Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of nitzoxanide in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function has not been studied.</p><h3>8.7 HIV-Infected or Immunodeficient Patients</h3><p class="First">ALINIA Tablets and ALINIA for Oral Suspension have not been studied for the treatment of diarrhea caused by G. lamblia in HIV-infected or immunodeficient patients. ALINIA Tablets and ALINIA for Oral Suspension have not been shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of diarrhea caused by C. parvum in HIV-infected or immunodeficient patients [ see Clinical Studies (14)]</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Limited information on nitazoxanide overdosage is available. Single oral doses of up to 4000 mg nitazoxanide have been administered to healthy adult volunteers without significant adverse effects. In the event of overdose, gastric lavage may be appropriate soon after oral administration. Patients should be observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment. There is no specific antidote for overdose with ALINIA. Because tizoxanide is highly protein bound (&gt;99.9%), dialysis is unlikely to significantly reduce plasma concentrations of the drug.</p><h2>Alinia Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">ALINIA Tablets and ALINIA for Oral Suspension contain the active ingredient, nitazoxanide, a synthetic antiprotozoal for oral administration. Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.
