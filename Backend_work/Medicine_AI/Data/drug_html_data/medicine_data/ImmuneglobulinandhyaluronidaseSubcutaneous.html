</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for immune globulin and hyaluronidase</h2><p>Immune globulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase injection is used to treat primary immunodeficiency (PI) in adults.</p><p>Immune globulin injection belongs to a group of medicines known as immunizing agents. It is used to prevent or treat diseases that occur when your body has a weak immune system. Immune globulin contains antibodies that make your immune system stronger. Hyaluronidase injection is a spreading substance that helps improve the uptake of immune globulin into the body.</p><p>Immune globulin and hyaluronidase is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using immune globulin and hyaluronidase</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For immune globulin and hyaluronidase, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to immune globulin and hyaluronidase or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of immune globulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase injection in the pediatric population. Safety has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of immune globulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of immune globulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related blood clotting problems, kidney or heart problems, which may require caution for patients receiving immune globulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking immune globulin and hyaluronidase, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using immune globulin and hyaluronidase with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
