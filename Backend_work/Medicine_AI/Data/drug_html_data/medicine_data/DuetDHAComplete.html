Duet<span class="Sup">®</span> DHA Complete is also useful in improving the nutritional status prior to conception.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients, including fish or fish oil.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING</span>: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or a poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First">Since daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) from fish oils may have potential antithrombotic activities and may increase bleeding times, administration of DHA should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses, including those taking anticoagulants.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia (hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive).</p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Pyridoxine supplements should be avoided in patients receiving levodopa alone, as the actions of levodopa may be antagonized.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Before, during and after pregnancy, one tablet and one enteric-coated softgel capsule taken by mouth daily, or as directed by a physician. The tablet and enteric-coated softgel capsule may be taken together or at different times of the day. Caution should be exercised to ensure that the prescribed dose of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1,000 mg) per day.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">NDC 66479-890-30.
