</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for ICG for Injection Set</h2><p class="First">ICG for Injection Set, a tricarbocyanine dye, is indicated for use with the KARL STORZ ICG Imaging System to provide real-time endoscopic visible and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP used in conjunction with the KARL STORZ ICG Imaging System enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgery using standard endoscopic visible light as well as:</p><h3>Visual assessment of vessels, blood flow and related tissue perfusion</h3><p class="First"> </p><h3>Visual assessment of at least one of the major extra-hepatic bile ducts (cystic duct, common bile duct and common hepatic duct), using near-infrared imaging.</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Visual assessment of at least one of the major extra-hepatic bile ducts (cystic duct, common bile duct and common hepatic duct), using near-infrared imaging. Fluorescence imaging of biliary ducts with the KARL STORZ ICG Imaging System is intended for use with standard of care white light and, when indicated, intraoperative cholangiography. The device is not intended for standalone use for biliary duct visualization.</span></p><h2>ICG for Injection Set Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Perfusion Assessment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation of ICG for Administration</span></p><p>Under sterile conditions, reconstitute one (1) 25 mg vial of Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP using one (1) 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP vial located in the ICG for Injection Set. Shake the ICG vial gently to dissolve. After reconstitution, a 25 mg vial of ICG contains 2.5 mg of dye per mL of solution, so a 1.0 mL injection contains a 2.5 mg dose of ICG.</p><p>Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP must be used within 6 hours after reconstitution. If a precipitate is present, discard the solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage</span></p><p>A 3 mL (7.5 mg) dose followed by a 10 mL bolus of saline is recommended. Multiple doses can be administered as required, up to the maximum recommended dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Maximum recommended dose</span></p><p>The total dose of dye injected should be kept below 2 mg/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Timing of ICG Administration</span></p><p>ICG fluorescence is quickly visible within blood vessels, tissue and organs, and it does not last very long (refer to Table 1 below).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood Vessels</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Organs (Kidney, Liver, Adrenal Gland, Small Bowel)</span></p><p class="First">See within:</p><p class="First">5-30 seconds</p><p class="First">1-2 minutes</p><p class="First">Visibility lasts:</p><p class="First">20-30 seconds</p><p class="First">20-120 minutes</p><p>For fluorescence imaging of PERFUSION in blood vessels, administration of the ICG should be performed at the time fluorescence imaging is requested by the physician. Multiple imaging sequences may be performed as necessary [up to the maximum dose (2 mg/kg of patient body weight)], so it is recommended to withdraw the desired dosage of ICG solution for each planned imaging sequence into separate syringes ahead of time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Method of Administration</span></p><p>ICG administration is to be performed via a central or peripheral venous line. Inject the prepared dose of ICG solution into the central or peripheral line as a tight bolus and immediately followed by a bolus of 10-12 mL of normal saline for injection.</p><h3>Extra-Hepatic Biliary Anatomy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation of ICG for Administration</span></p><p>Under sterile conditions, reconstitute one (1) 25 mg vial of Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP using one (1) 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP vial located in the ICG for Injection Set. Shake the ICG vial gently to dissolve. After reconstitution, a 25 mg vial of ICG contains 2.5 mg of dye per mL of solution, so a 1.0 mL injection contains a 2.5 mg dose of ICG.</p><p>Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP must be used within 6 hours after reconstitution. If a precipitate is present, discard the solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage</span></p><p>A 0.02 mL/kg dose that is scaled to the patientâ€™s weight is recommended. This provides 0.05 mg/kg of ICG.</p><p><span class="Bold">Maximum recommended dose</span></p><p>The total dose of dye injected should be kept below 2 mg/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Timing of ICG Administration</span></p><p>Following intravenous injection, ICG is rapidly bound to plasma protein, of which albumin is the principle carrier (95%). ICG is taken up from the plasma almost exclusively by the hepatic parenchymal cells and is secreted entirely into the bile. For optimal fluorescence imaging of Extra-Hepatic Biliary Anatomy, ICG should be administered at least 45 minutes prior to the time fluorescence imaging is desired by the physician. If this preoperative administration is not performed, however, ICG can be administered once the patient is in the OR, as adequate fluorescence imaging is possible in as little as 15 minutes after IV injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Method of Administration</span></p><p>ICG administration is to be performed via a central or peripheral venous line. Inject the prepared weight-scaled dose of ICG solution into the central or peripheral line as a tight bolus and immediately followed by a bolus of 10-12 mL of normal saline for injection.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP is a sterile, lyophilized green powder containing 25 mg of indocyanine green with no more than 5% sodium iodide.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP contains sodium iodide and should be used with caution in patients who have a history of allergy to iodides because of the risk of anaphylaxis.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Deaths from anaphylaxis have been reported following Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP administration during cardiac catheterization.</p><h3>Drug Instability</h3><p class="First">Indocyanine Green for Injection, USP is unstable in aqueous solution and must be used within 6 hours.
