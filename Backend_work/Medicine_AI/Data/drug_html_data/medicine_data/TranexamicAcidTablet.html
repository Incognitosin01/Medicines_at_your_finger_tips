Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. In the event of such symptoms, patients should be instructed to discontinue Tranexamic Acid Tablets immediately and should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. </p><p><span class="Bold">Concomitant Use of Hormonal Contraceptives</span></p><p>Combined hormonal contraceptives are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, the risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke, may increase further when combined hormonal contraceptives are administered with Tranexamic Acid Tablets. This is of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especially smokers over 35 years of age.</p><p>Women using combined hormonal contraception were excluded from the clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of Tranexamic Acid Tablets, and there are no clinical trial data on the risk of thrombotic events with the concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives. However, there have been US postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events in women who have used Tranexamic Acid Tablets concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Concomitant Use with Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates</span></p><p>Tranexamic Acid Tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.3)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. </p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Taking Concomitant All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin)</span></p><p>Tranexamic Acid Tablets is not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].  </p><h3>Severe Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">A case of severe allergic reaction to Tranexamic Acid Tablets was reported in the clinical trials, involving a subject who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment. A case of anaphylactic shock has also been reported in the literature, involving a patient who received an intravenous bolus of tranexamic acid. Tranexamic Acid Tablets are contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with known hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid.</p><h3>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</h3><p class="First">Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><h3>Ligneous Conjunctivitis</h3><p class="First">Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking Tranexamic Acid Tablets. The conjunctivitis resolved following cessation of Tranexamic Acid Tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Short-term Studies</span></p><p>The safety of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in females of reproductive potential was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)</span>].</p><ul>
<li>Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of Tranexamic Acid Tablets (1,950 mg and 3,900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over a 3-cycle treatment duration. A total of 304 women were randomized to this study, with 115 receiving at least one dose of 3,900 mg/day of Tranexamic Acid Tablets.</li>
<li>Study 2 compared the effects of tranexamic acid (3,900 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6-cycle treatment duration. A total of 196 women were randomized to this study, with 117 receiving at least one dose of Tranexamic Acid Tablets.</li>
</ul><p>Across the studies, the combined exposure to 3,900 mg/day Tranexamic Acid Tablets was 947 cycles and the average duration of use was 3.4 days per cycle. In both studies, subjects were generally healthy women who had menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL. In these studies, subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to 35 days, and a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 32 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. On average, subjects had a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the trials.</p><p>A list of adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects and more frequently in Tranexamic Acid Tablets-treated subjects receiving 3,900 mg/day compared to placebo-treated subjects is provided in Table 2.</p><p>*Adverse reactions that were reported by ≥ 5% of Tranexamic Acid Tablets-treated subject and more frequently in Tranexamic Acid Tablets-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Includes headache and tension headache</p><p><span class="Sup">b</span> Nasal and sinus symptoms include nasal, respiratory tract and sinus congestion, sinusitis, acute sinusitis, sinus headache, allergic sinusitis and sinus pain, and multiple allergies and seasonal allergies</p><p><span class="Sup">c</span> Abdominal pain includes abdominal tenderness and discomfort</p><p><span class="Sup">d</span> Musculoskeletal pain includes musculoskeletal discomfort and myalgia</p><p><span class="Sup">e</span> Arthralgia includes joint stiffness and swelling</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Long-term Studies</span></p><p>Long-term safety of tranexamic acid was studied in two open-label studies. In one study, subjects with physician-diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding (not using the alkaline hematin methodology) were treated with 3,900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 781 subjects were enrolled and 239 completed the study through 27 menstrual cycles. A total of 12.4% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. Women using hormonal contraception were excluded from the study. The total exposure in this study to 3,900 mg/day tranexamic acid was 10,213 cycles. The average duration of tranexamic acid use was 2.9 days per cycle.</p><p>A long-term open-label extension study of subjects from the two short-term efficacy studies was also conducted in which subjects were treated with 3,900 mg/day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period for up to 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 288 subjects were enrolled and 196 subjects completed the study through 9 menstrual cycles. A total of 2.1% of the subjects withdrew due to adverse reactions. The total exposure to 3,900 mg/day Tranexamic Acid Tablets in this study was 1,956 cycles. The average duration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets use was 3.5 days per cycle.</p><p>The types and severity of adverse reactions in these two long-term open-label trials were similar to those observed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies although the percentage of subjects reporting them was greater in the 27-month study, most likely because of the longer study duration.</p><p>A case of severe allergic reaction to Tranexamic Acid Tablets was reported in the extension trial, involving a subject on her fourth cycle of treatment, who experienced dyspnea, tightening of her throat, and facial flushing that required emergency medical treatment.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with Tranexamic Acid Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul>

</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tranexamic Acid Tablets.</p><h3>Combined Hormonal Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Because Tranexamic Acid Tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and Tranexamic Acid Tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of Tranexamic Acid Tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h3>Tissue Plasminogen Activators</h3><p class="First">Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both Tranexamic Acid Tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue Tranexamic Acid Tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators.</p><h3>Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates</h3><p class="First">Tranexamic Acid Tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>.</p><h3>All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin)</h3><p class="First">Tranexamic Acid Tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span> ].</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Tranexamic Acid Tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women<span class="Bold">.</span> There are no available data on Tranexamic Acid Tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta.

It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1,500 mg/kg/day in both F<span class="Sub">0</span> and F<span class="Sub">1</span> generations, which is equivalent to 4 times the recommended human oral dose of 3,900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>)</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Tranexamic acid is present in the mother’s milk at a concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid a nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic  acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Tranexamic Acid Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Tranexamic Acid Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>One hour after the last dose following a 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Tranexamic Acid Tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic Acid Tablets are not indicated before menarche.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Tranexamic Acid Tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Tranexamic Acid Tablets has not been studied. Because only a small fraction of the drug is metabolized, the recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There are no known cases of intentional overdose with Tranexamic Acid Tablets and no subjects in the clinical program took more than 2 times the prescribed amount of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in a 24-hour period (&gt;7800 mg/day). However, cases of overdose of tranexamic acid have been reported. Based on these reports, symptoms of overdose may include gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea); hypotensive (e.g., orthostatic symptoms); thromboembolic (arterial, venous, embolic); visual impairment; mental status changes; myoclonus; or rash. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Tranexamic Acid Tablets. In the event of overdose, employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., clinical monitoring and supportive therapy) as dictated by the patient's clinical status.</p><h2>Tranexamic Acid Tablet Description</h2><p class="First">Tranexamic Acid Tablets are an antifibrinolytic drug administered orally. The chemical name is trans-4-aminomethyl-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. The structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Tranexamic acid is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and in glacial acetic acid and is very slightly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in ether. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 157.2.</p><p>Tranexamic Acid Tablets are provided as white to off-white, oval, biconvex tablets. Engraved “APO” on one side, “TRA 650” on the other side. The active ingredient in each tablet is 650 mg tranexamic acid. The inactive ingredients contained in each tablet are: ethylcellulose 7FP, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.</p><h2>Tranexamic Acid Tablet - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin’s matrix structure.  </p><p>The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (K<span class="Sub">d</span> = 750 μmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (K<span class="Sub">d</span> = 1.1 μmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Tranexamic acid, at <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> concentrations of 25 to 100 microM, reduces by 20% to 60% the maximal rate of plasmin lysis of fibrin catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).</p><p>Elevated concentrations of endometrial, uterine, and menstrual blood tPA are observed in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) compared to women with normal menstrual blood loss. The effect of tranexamic acid on lowering endometrial tPA activity and menstrual fluid fibrinolysis is observed in women with HMB receiving Tranexamic Acid Tablets total oral doses of 2 to 3 g/day for 5 days.</p><p>In healthy subjects, tranexamic acid at blood concentrations less than 10 mg/mL has no effect on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood. Tranexamic acid, however, at blood concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of Tranexamic Acid Tablets on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover study in 48 healthy females aged 18 to 49 years. Subjects received (1) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 1,300 mg, (2) Tranexamic Acid Tablets 3,900 mg (three times the maximum recommended single dose), (3) moxifloxacin 400 mg, and (4) placebo. There was no significant increase in the corrected QT interval at any time up to 24 hours after the administration of either dose of Tranexamic Acid Tablets. Moxifloxacin, the active control, was associated with a maximum 14.1 msec mean increase in corrected QT interval (moxifloxacin – placebo) at 3 hours after administration.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>After a single oral administration of 1,300 mg of Tranexamic Acid Tablets, the peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) occurred at approximately 3 hours (T<span class="Sub">max</span>). The absolute bioavailability of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in women aged 18 to 49 is approximately 45%. Following multiple oral doses (1,300 mg tablets three times daily) administration of Tranexamic Acid Tablets for 5 days, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased by approximately 19% and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) remained unchanged, compared to a single oral dose administration (1,300 mg).

In a randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study of two dose levels (650 mg and 1,300 mg), pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid was evaluated in 20 female adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values after a single oral dose of 650 mg in the adolescent females were 32% to 36% less than those after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values after a single oral dose of 1,300 mg in the adolescent females were 20% to 25% less than those in the adult females given the same dose in a separate study. <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations</span> (8.4)]</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic Acid Tablets has not been evaluated. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid in 28 patients, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4 to 2.8, 2.8 to 5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51%, 39%, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, a lower dosage is needed in patients with renal impairment [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].  </p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of Tranexamic Acid Tablets has not been evaluated. One percent and 0.5 percent of an oral dose are excreted as a dicarboxylic acid and acetylated metabolite, respectively.

The procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid may have been exacerbated by concomitant use of tranexamic acid. Therefore, Tranexamic Acid Tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.4)</span>].</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies with tranexamic acid in male mice at doses as high as 6 times the recommended human dose of 3,900 mg/day showed an increased incidence of leukemia which may have been related to treatment.

These doses are approximately 2, 5, and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human oral dose of 3,900 mg/day based on AUC. At 6 times the human dose, some dogs developed reversible reddening and gelatinous discharge from the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed reversible changes in the nictitating membrane/conjunctiva. In some female dogs, the presence of inflammatory exudate over the bulbar conjunctival mucosa was observed. Histopathological examinations did not reveal any retinal alteration. No adverse effects were observed at 5 times the human dose.</p><p>In other studies, focal areas of retinal degeneration were observed in cats, dogs and rats following oral or intravenous tranexamic acid doses at 6 to 40 times the recommended usual human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (actual animal doses between 250 to 1,600 mg/kg/day).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Overview of the Clinical Studies</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Tranexamic Acid Tablets in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive potential was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: one 3-cycle treatment study (Study 1) and one 6-cycle treatment study (Study 2) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions</span> (6.1)]. In these studies, HMB was defined as an average menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL as assessed by alkaline hematin analysis of collected sanitary products over two baseline menstrual cycles. Subjects were 18 to 49 years of age with a mean age of approximately 40 years, had cyclic menses every 21 to35 days, and a BMI of approximately 32 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. On average, subjects had an HMB history of approximately 10 years and 40% had fibroids as determined by transvaginal ultrasound. Approximately 70% were Caucasian, 25% were Black, and 5% were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Other. Seven percent (7%) of all subjects were of Hispanic origin.</p><p>In these studies, the primary outcome measure was menstrual blood loss (MBL), measured using the alkaline hematin method. The endpoint was change from baseline in MBL, calculated by subtracting the mean MBL during treatment from the mean pretreatment MBL. The key secondary outcome measures were based on specific questions concerning limitations in social or leisure activities (LSLA) and limitations in physical activities (LPA). Large stains (soiling beyond undergarment) were also included as a key secondary outcome measure.</p><h3>Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in the Three-Cycle Treatment Study</h3><p class="First">Study 1 compared the effects of two doses of Tranexamic Acid Tablets (1,950 mg and 3,900 mg per day for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo on MBL over a 3-cycle treatment duration.

Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was statistically significantly reduced in patients treated with 3,900 mg/day Tranexamic Acid Tablets compared to placebo.
