It may also be used to treat water retention (edema) in patients with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or a kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome.</p><p>Spironolactone helps prevent your body from absorbing too much salt and keeps your potassium levels from getting too low. It can be used to prevent or treat hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).</p><p>Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide are both diuretic medicines (water pills). They reduce the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.</p><p>Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
