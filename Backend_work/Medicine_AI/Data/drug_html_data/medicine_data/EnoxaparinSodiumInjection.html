Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer Enoxaparin Sodium Injection through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister Enoxaparin Sodium Injection with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, to prevent mixing of drugs. Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.</p><h3>Monitoring for Safety</h3><p class="First">During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.</p><p>Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.</p><p>In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection.</p><p>If during Enoxaparin Sodium Injection therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is available in two concentrations:</p><p><span class="Bold">100 mg/mL Concentration</span></p><p class="First">-Prefilled Syringes</p><p class="First">30 mg / 0.3 mL, 40 mg / 0.4 mL</p><p class="First">-Graduated Prefilled Syringes</p><p class="First">60 mg / 0.6 mL, 80 mg / 0.8 mL, 100 mg / 1 mL</p><p class="First">-Multiple-Dose Vials</p><p class="First">300 mg / 3 mL</p><p><span class="Bold">150 mg/mL Concentration</span></p><p class="First"> -Graduated Prefilled Syringes</p><p class="First"> 120 mg / 0.8 mL, 150 mg / 1 mL</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Risk of Hemorrhage</h3><p class="First">Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)</span>].<br/>
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].<br/>
Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.<br/>
Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice-daily or 40 mg once daily) of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection.<br/>
Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice daily dose should not receive the second Enoxaparin Sodium Injection dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal.<br/>
Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Enoxaparin Sodium Injection dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].<br/>
Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and<br/>
motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction.<br/>
Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms.<br/>
If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.<br/>
Use Enoxaparin Sodium Injection with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet<br/>
inhibitors.<br/>
Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported.<br/>
Some of these cases have been fatal.<br/>
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Bleeding following Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization Procedures</h3><p class="First">To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Enoxaparin<br/>
Sodium Injection doses. It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI.In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/ subcutaneous Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. If the treatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma<br/>
formation [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span>].</p><h3>Increased Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Concomitant Medical Conditions</h3><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage.</p><h3>Risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with or without Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection may cause Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) or Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis (HITTS). HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely.<br/>
Use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].<br/>
Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.<br/>
Only use Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in patients with a history of HIT, if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use Enoxaparin Sodium Injection<br/>
in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after nonheparin alternative treatments are considered.</p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection.<br/>
Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and 50,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.<br/>
Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Enoxaparin<br/>
Sodium Injection, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>, Enoxaparin Sodium Injection should be discontinued.</p><h3>Interchangeability with Other Heparins</h3><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage. Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves</h3><p class="First">Use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may result in valve thrombosis. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves given Enoxaparin Sodium Injection (1 mg/kg twice daily) to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal and fetal death. No patients in the heparin/warfin group (0 of 4 women) died. There also have been isolated postmarketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving Enoxaparin Sodium Injection for thromboprophylaxis. Women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy, and, when pregnant, have a higher rate of fetal loss from stillbirth, spontaneous abortion and premature delivery. Therefore, frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-Factor Xa levels, and adjusting of dosage may be needed [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</span>].</p><h3>Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative</h3><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials are not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Enoxaparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials. The “gasping syndrome” is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known<br/>
(Enoxaparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials contain 15 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].<br/>
Because benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, if anticoagulation with Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is needed during pregnancy, use the preservative-free formulations where possible [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling:<br/>
• Spinal/epidural hematoma [<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]<br/>
• Increased Risk of Hemorrhage [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]<br/>
• Thrombocytopenia [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. During clinical development for the approved indications, 15,918 patients were exposed to Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. These included 1,228 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following abdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,368 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery, 711 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness, 1,578 for prophylaxis of ischemic complications in unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, 10,176 for treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 857 for treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. Enoxaparin Sodium Injection doses in the clinical trials for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following abdominal or hip or knee replacement surgery or in medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness ranged from 40 mg subcutaneously once daily to 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily. In the clinical studies for prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction doses were 1 mg/kg every 12 hours and in the clinical studies for treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction Enoxaparin Sodium Injection doses were a 30 mg intravenous bolus followed by 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hemorrhage</span></p><p>The following rates of major bleeding events have been reported during clinical trials with<br/>

In a clinical trial in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 1.5%.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.<br/>
There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.<br/>
Local reactions at the injection site (e.g., nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g., pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, rare cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>] have been reported.<br/>
Cases of hyperkalemia have been reported. Most of these reports occurred in patients who also had conditions that tend toward the development of hyperkalemia (e.g., renal dysfunction, concomitant potassium-sparing drugs, administration of potassium, hematoma in body tissues). Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have also been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.<br/>
Cases of headache, hemorrhagic anemia, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury have been reported.<br/>
Osteoporosis has also been reported following long-term therapy.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Whenever possible, agents which may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection therapy. These agents include medications such as: anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid, salicylates, NSAIDs (including ketorolac tromethamine), dipyridamole, or sulfinpyrazone. If co-administration is essential, conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Placental transfer of enoxaparin was observed in the animal studies. Human data from a retrospective cohort study, which included 693 live births, suggest that enoxaparin does not increase the risk of major developmental abnormalities (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). Based on animal data, Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is not predicted to increase the risk of major developmental abnormalities (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>).<br/>
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background<br/>
risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
Pregnancy alone confers an increased risk for thromboembolism that is even higher for women with thromboembolic disease and certain high risk pregnancy conditions. While not adequately studied, pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at even higher risk for thrombosis [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</span>]. Pregnant women with thromboembolic disease, including those with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and those with inherited or acquired thrombophilias, have an increased risk of other maternal complications and fetal loss regardless of the type of anticoagulant used.<br/>
All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding. Pregnant women receiving Enoxaparin Sodium Injection should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or excessive anticoagulation. Consideration for use of a shorter acting anticoagulant should be specifically addressed as delivery approaches [see Boxed Warning]. Hemorrhage can occur at any site and may lead to death of mother and/or fetus. Pregnant women should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the mother if Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is administered during pregnancy.<br/>
It is not known if monitoring of anti-Factor Xa activity and dose adjustment (by weight or anti-Factor Xa activity) of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection affect the safety and the efficacy of the drug during pregnancy.<br/>
Cases of “gasping syndrome” have occurred in premature infants when large amounts of benzyl alcohol have been administered (99-405 mg/kg/day). The multiple-dose vial of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection contains 15 mg benzyl alcohol per 1 mL as a preservative [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
Human Data<br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. A retrospective study reviewed the records of 604 women who used Enoxaparin Sodium Injection during pregnancy. A total of 624 pregnancies resulted in 693 live births. There were 72 hemorrhagic events (11 serious) in 63 women. There were 14 cases of neonatal hemorrhage. Major congenital anomalies in live births occurred at rates (2.5%) similar to background rates. There have been postmarketing reports of fetal death when pregnant women received Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. Causality for these cases has not been determined.<br/>
Insufficient data, the underlying disease, and the possibility of inadequate anticoagulation complicate the evaluation of these cases.<br/>
A clinical study using Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves has been conducted [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>].<br/>
Animal data<br/>
Teratology studies have been conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin up to 15 times the recommended human dose (by comparison with 2 mg/kg as the maximum recommended daily dose). There was no evidence of teratogenic effects or fetotoxicity due to enoxaparin. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
It is unknown whether Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is excreted in human milk. In lactating rats, the passage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in the milk is very limited. There is no information available on the effect of enoxaparin or its metabolites on the breastfed child, or on the milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Enoxaparin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in pediatric patients have not been<br/>
established.<br/>
Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is not approved for use in neonates or infants.<br/>
Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the “gasping syndrome” occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial<br/>
hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. Enoxaparin Sodium Injection multiple-dose vials contain 15 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol (at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg twice a day, benzyl alcohol exposure in patients is 0.45 mg/kg daily) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Hip, Knee and Abdominal Surgery; Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis, Prevention of Ischemic Complications of Unstable Angina and Non-Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction</span><br/>
Over 2800 patients, 65 years and older, have received Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in clinical trials. The efficacy of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in the geriatric (≥65 years) was similar to that seen in younger patients (&lt;65 years). The incidence of bleeding complications was similar between geriatric and younger patients when 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once a day doses of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection were employed. The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients when Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was administered at doses of 1.5 mg/kg once a day or 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. The risk of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection-associated bleeding increased with age. Serious adverse events increased with age for patients receiving Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. Other clinical experience (including postmarketing surveillance and literature reports) has not revealed additional differences in the safety of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection between geriatric and younger patients. Careful attention to dosing intervals and concomitant medications (especially antiplatelet medications) is advised. Enoxaparin Sodium Injection should be used with care in geriatric patients who may show delayed elimination of enoxaparin. Monitoring of geriatric patients with low body weight (&lt;45 kg) and those predisposed to decreased renal function should be considered [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction</span><br/>
In the clinical study for treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, there was no evidence of difference in efficacy between patients ≥75 years of age (n = 1241) and patients less than 75 years of age (n = 9015). Patients ≥75 years of age did not receive a 30 mg intravenous bolus prior to the normal dosage regimen and had their subcutaneous dose adjusted to 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hours [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>]. The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in patients ≥65 years of age as compared to younger patients (&lt;65 years).</p><h3>Patients with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves</h3><p class="First">The use of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and has not been adequately studied for long-term use in this patient population. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received Enoxaparin Sodium Injection for thromboprophylaxis. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal and fetal deaths. Insufficient data, the underlying disease and the possibility of inadequate anticoagulation complicate the evaluation of these cases. Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium. All such patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Because exposure of enoxaparin sodium is significantly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min), a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic dosage ranges. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to &lt;50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. In patients with renal failure, treatment with Enoxaparin Sodium Injection has been associated with the development of hyperkalemia [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><h3>Low-Weight Patients</h3><p class="First">An increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been observed in low-weight women (&lt;45 kg) and low-weight men (&lt;57 kg). Observe low-weight patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Obese Patients</h3><p class="First">Obese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in obese patients (BMI &gt;30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose adjustment. Observe these patients carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Accidental overdosage following administration of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection may lead to hemorrhagic complications. Injected Enoxaparin Sodium Injection may be largely neutralized by the slow intravenous injection of protamine sulfate (1% solution). The dose of protamine sulfate should be equal to the dose of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection injected: 1 mg protamine sulfate should be administered to neutralize 1 mg Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, if Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was administered in the previous 8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 1 mg of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection may be administered if Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine administration, or if it has been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. The second infusion of 0.5 mg protamine sulfate per 1 mg of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection may be administered if the aPTT measured 2 to 4 hours after the first infusion remains prolonged.<br/>
If at least 12 hours have elapsed since the last Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, protamine administration may not be required; however, even with higher doses of protamine, the aPTT may remain more prolonged than following administration of heparin. In all cases, the anti-Factor Xa activity is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%). Particular care should be taken to avoid overdosage with protamine sulfate. Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions. Because fatal reactions, often resembling anaphylaxis, have been reported with protamine sulfate, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactic shock are readily available. For additional information consult the labeling of protamine sulfate injection products.</p><h2>Enoxaparin Sodium Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection USP is a sterile aqueous solution containing enoxaparin sodium, a low molecular weight heparin. The pH of the injection is 5.5 to 7.5.<br/>
Enoxaparin sodium is obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. Its structure is characterized by a 2-O-sulfo-4-enepyranosuronic acid group at the non-reducing end and a 2-N,6-O-disulfo-D-glucosamine at the reducing end of the chain. About 20% (ranging between 15% and 25%) of the enoxaparin structure contains a 1,6 anhydro derivative on the reducing end of the polysaccharide chain. The drug substance is the sodium salt. The average molecular weight is about 4500 daltons.

The Enoxaparin Sodium Injection USP prefilled syringes and graduated prefilled syringes are preservative-free and intended for use only as a single-dose injection. The multiple-dose vial contains 15 mg benzyl alcohol per 1 mL as a preservative [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling(16)</span>].</p><h2>Enoxaparin Sodium Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin, which has antithrombotic properties.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean ±SD, 14.0±3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) compared to the ratios observed for heparin (mean ±SD, 1.22±0.13). Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n=1607). A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT postinjection values of 50 seconds. The average aPTT prolongation value on Day 1 was about 16% higher than on Day 4.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
Pharmacokinetic trials were conducted using the 100 mg/mL formulation. Maximum anti-Factor Xa and anti-thrombin (anti-Factor IIa) activities occur 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin. Mean peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 0.16 IU/mL (1.58 mcg/mL) and 0.38 IU/mL (3.83 mcg/mL) after the 20 mg and the 40 mg clinically tested subcutaneous doses, respectively. Mean (n = 46) peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 1.1 IU/mL at steady state in patients with unstable angina receiving 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days. Mean absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin, after 1.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously, based on anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately 100% in healthy subjects.<br/>
A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours provided initial peak anti-Factor Xa levels of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 84% of steady-state levels. Steady state is achieved on the second day of treatment.<br/>
Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics appear to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>]. After repeated subcutaneous administration of 40 mg once daily and 1.5 mg/kg once-daily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about 15% higher than after a single dose. Steady-state enoxaparin activity levels are well predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 1 mg/kg twice-daily regimen, the steady state is reached from day 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single dose and mean peak and trough levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively. Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range.<br/>
Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose. When a daily 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/mL or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained (see Table 13).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">A</span><span class="Sub">max</span><br/>

Apparent clearance and A<span class="Sub">max</span> derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females.

Apparent clearance and A<span class="Sub">max</span> derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal impairment</span><br/>
A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to &lt;50 mL/min renal impairment after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hemodialysis</span><br/>

For patients younger than 75 years of age, Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was given as a single 30 mg intravenous bolus plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by a subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. For patients at least 75 years of age, the intravenous bolus was not given and the subcutaneous dose was reduced to 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hours. For patients with severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL per minute), the dose was to be modified to 1 mg/kg every 24 hours. The subcutaneous injections of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). The mean treatment duration for Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was 6.6 days. The mean treatment duration of unfractionated heparin was 54 hours.<br/>
When percutaneous coronary intervention was performed during study medication period, patients received antithrombotic support with blinded study drug. For patients on Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, the PCI was to be performed on Enoxaparin Sodium Injection (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies, i.e. no additional dosing, if the last subcutaneous administration was less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg Enoxaparin Sodium Injection if the last subcutaneous administration was more than 8 hours before balloon inflation.<br/>
All patients were treated with aspirin for a minimum of 30 days. Eighty percent of patients received a fibrin-specific agent (19% tenecteplase, 5% reteplase and 55% alteplase) and 20% received streptokinase.<br/>
Among 20,479 patients in the ITT population, the mean age was 60 years, and 76% were male. Racial distribution was: 87% Caucasian, 9.8% Asian, 0.2% Black, and 2.8% other. Medical history included previous MI (13%), hypertension (44%), diabetes (15%) and angiographic evidence of CAD (5%). Concomitant medication included aspirin (95%), beta- blockers (86%), ACE inhibitors (78%), statins (70%) and clopidogrel (27%). The MI at entry was anterior in 43%, non-anterior in 56%, and both in 1%.<br/>
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after randomization. Total follow-up was one year.<br/>
The rate of the primary efficacy endpoint (death or myocardial re-infarction) was 9.9% in the Enoxaparin Sodium Injection group, and 12% in the unfractionated heparin group, a 17% reduction in the relative risk, (P=0.000003) (see Table 25).</p><p class="First">Outcome at 48 hours</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Death or Myocardial Re-infarction</p><p class="First">478 (4.7)</p><p class="First">531 (5.2)</p><p class="First">0.90 (0.80 to 1.01)</p><p class="First">0.08</p><p class="First">  Death</p><p class="First">383 (3.7)</p><p class="First">390 (3.8)</p><p class="First">0.98 (0.85 to 1.12)</p><p class="First">0.76</p><p class="First">  Myocardial Re-infarction</p><p class="First">102 (1.0)</p><p class="First">156 (1.5)</p><p class="First">0.65 (0.51 to 0.84)</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">Urgent Revascularization</p><p class="First">74 (0.7)</p><p class="First">96 (0.9)</p><p class="First">0.77 (0.57 to 1.04)</p><p class="First">0.09</p><p class="First">Death or Myocardial Re-infarction or Urgent Revascularization</p><p class="First">548 (5.3)</p><p class="First">622 (6.1)</p><p class="First">0.88 (0.79 to 0.98)</p><p class="First">0.02</p><p class="First">Outcome at 8 Days</p><p class="First">Death or Myocardial Re-infarction</p><p class="First">740 (7.2)</p><p class="First">954 (9.3)</p><p class="First">0.77 (0.71 to 0.85)</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">  Death</p><p class="First">559 (5.5)</p><p class="First">605 (5.9)</p><p class="First">0.92 (0.82 to 1.03)</p><p class="First">0.15</p><p class="First">  Myocardial Re-infarction</p><p class="First">204 (2.0)</p><p class="First">379 (3.7)</p><p class="First">0.54 (0.45 to 0.63)</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">Urgent Revascularization</p><p class="First">145 (1.4)</p><p class="First">247 (2.4)</p><p class="First">0.59 (0.48 to 0.72)</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">Death or Myocardial Re-infarction or Urgent Revascularization</p><p class="First">874 (8.5)</p><p class="First">1181 (11.6)</p><p class="First">0.74 (0.68 to 0.80)</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Outcome at 30 Days</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary efficacy endpoint</span><br/>

These results provide evidence that UFH was effective and that it would be better if used longer than 48 hours. There is a similar increase in endpoint event rate when Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was discontinued, suggesting that it too was discontinued too soon in this study.<br/>
The rates of major hemorrhages (defined as requiring 5 or more units of blood for transfusion, or 15% drop in hematocrit or clinically overt bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage) at 30 days were 2.1% in the Enoxaparin Sodium Injection group and 1.4% in the unfractionated heparin group. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at 30 days were 0.8% in the Enoxaparin Sodium Injection group and 0.7% in the unfractionated heparin group. The 30-day rate of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or ICH (a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower in the Enoxaparin Sodium Injection group (10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Enoxaparin Sodium Injection USP is available in two concentrations (see Tables 26 and 27)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prefilled Syringes</span>†<br/>
