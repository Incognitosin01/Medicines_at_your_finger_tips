</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Phenytoin Oral Suspension</h2><p class="First">Phenytoin Oral Suspension is indicated for the treatment of tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures.</p><h2>Phenytoin Oral Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE</p><p>A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device.</p><h3>Adult Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day).</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments</h3><p class="First">Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><p>With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days.</p><h3>Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations</h3><p class="First">The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Phenytoin Oral Suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Phenytoin extended capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia</h3><p class="First">Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Dosage</h3><p class="First">Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosing during Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span> Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Phenytoin Oral Suspension is available as a 125 mg phenytoin/5 mL oral suspension of orange color with an orange-vanilla flavor.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Phenytoin Oral Suspension is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus</h3><p class="First">Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.</p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p class="First">Epilepsy</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">3.5</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">Psychiatric</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">8.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">Other</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">Total</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h3>Serious Dermatologic Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophelia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span><span class="following_xmChange">]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin Oral Suspension should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs.</span></p><p>Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502.</p><p>The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.</p><h3>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin.</p><h3>Cardiac Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)<span class="following_xmChange">]</span></span><span class="following_xmChange">. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease.</span></p><h3>Angioedema</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the post marketing setting. Phenytoin Oral Suspension should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin Oral Suspension should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established.</span></p><h3>Hepatic Injury</h3><p class="First">Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span> Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered.</p><h3>Hematopoietic Complications</h3><p class="First">Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><p>In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs.</p><h3>Effects on Vitamin D and Bone</h3><p class="First">The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines.</p><h3>Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia</h3><p class="First">Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Porphyria</h3><p class="First">In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease.</p><h3>Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn</h3><p class="First">Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma.</p><p>A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin <span class="Italics">in utero</span>. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth.</p><h3>Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin</h3><p class="First">A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients.</p><h3>Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range</h3><p class="First">Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium," "psychosis," or "encephalopathy," or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Body as a Whole:</span> Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed as has angioedema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.7)]</span>.</p><p>Anaphylaxis has also been reported.</p><p>There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities.</p><p><span class="Bold">Digestive System:</span> Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hematologic and Lymphatic System:</span> Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Test Abnormality:</span> Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)],</span> alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous System:</span> The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].</span></p><p>A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Appendages:</span> Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Senses:</span> Altered taste sensation including metallic taste.</p><p><span class="Bold">Urogenital:</span> Peyronie's disease</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected.</p><p>Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes.</p><h3>Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations</h3><p class="First">Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations.

Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website <span class="Bold">http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes.

This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal data</span></p><p>Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia</h3><p class="First">The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.</p><p>Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span> Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote.</p><p>The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients.</p><p>In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind.</p><h2>Phenytoin Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Phenytoin is related to the barbiturates in chemical structure, but has a five-membered ring. The chemical name is 5,5-diphenyl-2,4 imidazolidinedione, having the following structural formula:</p><p>Each 5 mL of the oral suspension contains 125 mg of phenytoin, USP; carboxymethylcellulose sodium, citric acid anhydrous, FD&amp;C yellow no. 6, magnesium aluminum silicate, orange flavor spray dry natural and artificial, polysorbate 60, purified water, sodium benzoate, sucrose and vanilla flavored powder artificial.</p><h2>Phenytoin Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>For Phenytoin Oral Suspension, peak levels occur 1½ to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.</p><p>In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age: Geriatric Population:</span></p><p>Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sex/Race:</span></p><p>Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal or Hepatic Impairment:</span></p><p>Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span></p><p>It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.</p><p>Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span> <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span></p><p>In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10 mg/kg/day, 25 mg/kg/day, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years.
