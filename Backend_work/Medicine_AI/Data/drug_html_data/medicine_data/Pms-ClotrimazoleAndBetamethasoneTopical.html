<li>Ringworm of the foot (tinea pedis or athlete's foot),</li>
<li>Ringworm of the groin (tinea cruris or jock itch), and</li>
<li>Ringworm of the body (tinea corporis).</li>
</ul><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Pms-Clotrimazole And Betamethasone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
