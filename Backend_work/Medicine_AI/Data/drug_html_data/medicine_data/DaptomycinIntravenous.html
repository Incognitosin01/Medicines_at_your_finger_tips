It is also used to treat infections in the bloodstream, including right-sided infective endocarditis.</p><p>Daptomycin belongs to the class of medicines known as antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, daptomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Daptomycin is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using daptomycin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of daptomycin injection in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of daptomycin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have increased unwanted side effects, which may require caution in patients receiving daptomycin injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
