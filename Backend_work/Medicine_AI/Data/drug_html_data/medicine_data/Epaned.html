</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antihypertensive</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Enalapril</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Epaned</h2><p>Enalapril is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.</p><p>Enalapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, enalapril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p><p>Enalapril is also used in combination with other medicines to treat congestive heart failure and cut down on the number of hospital visits for heart problems.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Epaned</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of enalapril to treat hypertension in children 1 month to 16 years of age. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 1 month of age and in children with severe kidney disease.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of enalapril in geriatric patients. Elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving enalapril.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
