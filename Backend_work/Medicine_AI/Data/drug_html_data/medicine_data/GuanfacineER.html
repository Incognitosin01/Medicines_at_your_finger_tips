</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Guanfacine ER</h2><p class="First">Guanfacine extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><h2>Guanfacine ER Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Instruction for Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush, chew, or break tablets because this will increase the rate of guanfacine release.</span> Do not administer with high fat meals, due to increased exposure.</p><h3>Dose Selection</h3><p class="First">Take guanfacine extended-release tablets orally once daily, either in the morning or evening, at approximately the same time each day. Begin at a dose of 1 mg/day, and adjust in increments of no more than 1 mg/week.</p><p>In monotherapy clinical trials, there was dose- and exposure-related clinical improvement as well as risks for several clinically significant adverse reactions (hypotension, bradycardia, sedative events). To balance the exposure-related potential benefits and risks, the recommended target dose range depending on clinical response and tolerability for guanfacine extended-release tablets is 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day (total daily dose between 1 to 7 mg) (see Table 1).</p><p>In the adjunctive trial which evaluated guanfacine extended-release tablets treatment with psychostimulants, the majority of patients reached optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been studied in adjunctive trials.</p><h3>Switching from Immediate-Release Guanfacine to Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">If switching from immediate-release guanfacine, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with guanfacine extended-release tablets following above recommended schedule.</p><p>Do not substitute for immediate-release guanfacine tablets on a milligram-per-milligram basis, because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles. Guanfacine extended-release tablets have significantly reduced C<span class="Sub">max</span> (60% lower), bioavailability (43% lower), and a delayed T<span class="Sub">max</span> (3 hours later) compared to those of the same dose of immediate-release guanfacine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Maintenance Treatment</h3><p class="First">Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate the long-term use of guanfacine extended-release tablets, and adjust weight-based dosage as needed. The majority of children and adolescents reach optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been evaluated in children (ages 6 to 12 years) and above 7 mg/day have not been evaluated in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment</h3><p class="First">Following discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets, patients may experience increases in blood pressure and heart rate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.4) <span class="Italics">and Adverse Reactions</span> (6)]. Patients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue guanfacine extended-release tablets without consulting their health care provider. Monitor blood pressure and pulse when reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. Taper the daily dose in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension.</p><h3>Missed Doses</h3><p class="First"><span class="None">When reinitiating patients to the previous maintenance dose after two or more missed consecutive doses, consider titration based on patient tolerability.</span></p><h3>Dosage Adjustment with Concomitant Use of Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustments for guanfacine extended-release tablets are recommended with concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) (Table 2) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Guanfacine<span class="Sup"> </span>Extended-Release Tablets Dosage Adjustments for Patients Taking Concomitant CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Guanfacine extended-release tablets 1 mg are white to off-white, round, biconvex tablets, engraved "APO" on one side, "GU1" on the other side.</p><p>Guanfacine extended-release tablets 2 mg are white to off-white, oval shaped, biconvex tablets, engraved "APO" on one side, "GUA 2" on the other side.</p><p>Guanfacine extended-release tablets 3 mg are green, round, biconvex tablets, engraved "APO" on one side, "GU3" on the other side.</p><p>Guanfacine extended-release tablets 4 mg are green, oval shaped, biconvex tablets, engraved "APO" on one side, "GUA 4" on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Guanfacine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to guanfacine extended-release tablets or its inactive ingredients, or other products containing guanfacine. Rash and pruritus have been reported.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope</h3><p class="First">Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. </p><h3>Sedation and Somnolence</h3><p class="First">Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Before using guanfacine extended-release tablets with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol.</p><h3>Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended-release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs.</p><h3>Rebound Hypertension</h3><p class="First">In post marketing experience, abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets has resulted in clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension above baseline levels and increases in heart rate. Hypertensive encephalopathy has also been reported in association with rebound hypertension with both guanfacine extended-release tablets and immediate release guanfacine <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. In these cases, high-dosage guanfacine was discontinued; concomitant stimulant use was also reported, which may potentially increase hypertensive response upon abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine. Children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, and a resulting inability to take medications, so they may be especially at risk for rebound hypertension.  </p><p>To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>. Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing guanfacine extended-release tablets. If abrupt discontinuation occurs (especially with concomitant stimulant use), patients should be closely followed for rebound hypertension.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Sedation and somnolence <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Cardiac conduction abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Rebound Hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect clinical trial exposure to guanfacine extended-release tablets in 2,825 patients. This includes 2,330 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years and 495 patients in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers.</p><p>The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fixed Dose Trials</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Monotherapy Flexible Dose Trials</span></p><p>There were no specific adverse reactions ≥2% in any treatment group that led to discontinuation in the monotherapy flexible dose study (Study 5).</p><p><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Trial</span></p><p>There were no specific adverse reactions ≥2% in any treatment group that led to discontinuation in the short-term adjunctive study (Study 3).</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate</span></p><p>In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were −5.4 mmHg, −3.4 mmHg, and −5.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open-label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Discontinuation of Treatment</span></p><p>Blood pressure and pulse may increase above baseline values following discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. In five studies of children and adolescents <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>, increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3 mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of guanfacine extended-release tablets. In a maintenance of efficacy study, increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period, which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes.</p><p>In postmarketing experience, following abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets, rebound hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI)</span></p><p>Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies</span></p><p>Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include:</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">General:</span><span class="None"> edema, malaise, tremor </span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Cardiovascular:</span><span class="None"> palpitations, tachycardia</span>, rebound hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy </p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Central Nervous System:</span><span class="None"> paresthesias, vertigo</span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Eye Disorders:</span><span class="None"> blurred vision </span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Musculo-Skeletal System:</span><span class="None"> arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia</span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Psychiatric:</span><span class="None"><span class="None"> confusion, hallucinations</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Reproductive System, Male:</span><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"> erectile dysfunction</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Respiratory System:</span><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"> dyspnea</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"> alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash </span></span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Special Senses:</span><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"><span class="None"> alterations in taste</span></span></span></span></span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 14 contains clinically important drug interactions with guanfacine extended-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry  </span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications, including guanfacine extended-release tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD Medications at 1-866-961-2388.  </p><p>Risk Summary</p><p>Available data with guanfacine over decades of use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, use of guanfacine in pregnant women over this time has been infrequent. In animal reproduction studies, rabbits and rats exposed to 3 and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively, showed no adverse outcomes. However, higher doses were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity (see Data).  </p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  </p><p>Data  </p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data  </span></p><p>Reproduction studies conducted in rats have shown that guanfacine crosses the placenta. However, administration of guanfacine to rabbits and rats during organogenesis at 3 (rabbit) and 4 (rat) times the MRHD of 0.12 mg/kg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis resulted in no evidence of harm to the fetus. Higher doses (13.5 times the MRHD in both rabbits and rats) were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>There are no data on the presence of guanfacine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed infant. The effects on milk production are also unknown. Guanfacine is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). If a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. If an infant is exposed to guanfacine through breastmilk, monitor for symptoms of hypotension and bradycardia such as sedation, lethargy and poor feeding (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for guanfacine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from guanfacine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.  </p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p>Monitor breastfeeding infants exposed to guanfacine through breastmilk for sedation, lethargy, and poor feeding.  </p><p>Data</p><p>Guanfacine was excreted in breast milk of lactating rats at a concentration comparable to that observed in blood, but slightly less than the concentration in plasma when administered following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets was studied for the treatment of ADHD in five controlled monotherapy clinical trials (up to 15 weeks in duration), one randomized withdrawal study and one controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (8 weeks in duration) in children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 who met DSM-IV<span class="Sup">®</span> criteria for ADHD <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><br/>
Animal Data</span></p><p>In studies in juvenile rats, guanfacine alone produced a slight delay in sexual maturation in males and females at 2 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate produced a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased growth as measured by a decrease in bone length in males at a dose of guanfacine comparable to the MRHD and a dose of methylphenidate approximately 4 times the MRHD.</p><p>In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine alone from 7 to 59 days of age, development was delayed as indicated by a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased body weight gain in males at 2 mg/kg/day and in females at 3 mg/kg/day. The No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for delayed sexual maturation was 1 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to the MRHD of 4 mg/day, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The effects on fertility were not evaluated in this study.</p><p>In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate from 7 to 59 days of age, a decrease in ulna bone length and a slight delay in sexual maturation were observed in males given 1 mg/kg/day of guanfacine in combination with 50 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. The NOAELs for these findings were 0.3 mg/kg of guanfacine in combination with 16 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate, which are equivalent to 0.3 and 1.4 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day and 54 mg/day for guanfacine and methylphenidate, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. These findings were not observed with guanfacine alone at 1 mg/kg/day or methylphenidate alone at 50 mg/kg/day.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets in geriatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">It may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with significant impairment of renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">It may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with significant impairment of hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Guanfacine extended-release tablets is not a controlled substance and has no known potential for abuse or dependence.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Symptoms</span></p><p>Postmarketing reports of guanfacine overdosage indicate that hypotension, drowsiness, lethargy, and bradycardia have been observed following overdose. Initial hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension. Similar symptoms have been described in voluntary reports to the American Association of Poison Control Center’s National Poison Data System. Miosis of the pupils may be noted on examination<span class="None">.</span> No fatal overdoses of guanfacine have been reported in published literature.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p><p>Consult a Certified Poison Control Center by calling 1-800-222-1222 for up-to-date guidance and advice.</p><p>Management of guanfacine extended-release tablets overdose should include monitoring for and the treatment of initial hypertension, if that occurs, as well as hypotension, bradycardia, lethargy and respiratory depression. Children and adolescents who develop lethargy should be observed for the development of more serious toxicity including coma, bradycardia and hypotension for up to 24 hours, due to the possibility of delayed onset hypotension.</p><h2>Guanfacine ER Description</h2><p class="First">Guanfacine extended-release tablets are a once-daily, extended-release formulation of guanfacine hydrochloride in a matrix tablet formulation for oral administration only. The chemical designation is <span class="Italics">N</span>-amidino-2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl) acetamide monohydrochloride. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O·HCl corresponding to a molecular weight of 282.55 g/mol. The chemical structure is:</p><p>Guanfacine hydrochloride, USP is a white to off-white powder, sparingly soluble in water (approximately 1 mg/mL) and alcohol and slightly soluble in acetone. The only organic solvent in which it has relatively high solubility is methanol (&gt;30 mg/mL). Each tablet contains guanfacine hydrochloride, USP equivalent to 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, or 4 mg of guanfacine base. The tablets also contain anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, fumaric acid, hypromellose and magnesium stearate. In addition, the 3-mg and 4-mg tablets also contain FD&amp;C Blue #2 and ferric oxide yellow.</p><h2>Guanfacine ER - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Guanfacine is a central alpha<span class="Sub">2A</span>-adrenergic receptor agonist. Guanfacine is not a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mechanism of action of guanfacine in ADHD is not known.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Guanfacine is a selective central alpha<span class="Sub">2A</span>-adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has a 15 to 20 times higher affinity for this receptor subtype than for the alpha<span class="Sub">2B</span> or alpha<span class="Sub">2C</span> subtypes.</p><p>Guanfacine is a known antihypertensive agent. By stimulating central alpha<span class="Sub">2A</span>-adrenergic receptors, guanfacine reduces sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor center to the heart and blood vessels. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction in heart rate.</p><p>In a thorough QT study, the administration of two dose levels of immediate-release guanfacine (4 mg and 8 mg) produced concentrations approximately 2 to 4 times the concentrations observed with the maximum recommended dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets of 0.12 mg/kg. Guanfacine was not shown to prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption and Distribution</span></p><p>Guanfacine is readily absorbed and approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins independent of drug concentration. After oral administration of guanfacine extended-release tablets the time to peak plasma concentration is approximately 5 hours in children and adolescents with ADHD.</p><p>Immediate-release and extended-release guanfacine have different pharmacokinetic characteristics; dose substitution on a milligram per milligram basis will result in differences in exposure.</p><p>A comparison across studies suggests that the C<span class="Sub">max</span> is 60% lower and AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> 43% lower, respectively, for the extended-release compared to immediate-release guanfacine. Therefore, the relative bioavailability of the extended-release to immediate-release guanfacine is 58%. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters in adults following the administration of guanfacine extended-release tablets 1 mg once daily and immediate-release guanfacine 1mg once daily are summarized in Table 15.</p><p>Note: Values are mean +/- SD, except for t<span class="Sub">max</span> which is median (range)</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Comparison of Pharmacokinetics: Guanfacine Extended-Release vs. Immediate-Release Guanfacine in Adults</span></p><p></p><p>Exposure to guanfacine was higher in children (ages 6 to 12) compared to adolescents (ages 13 to 17) and adults. After oral administration of multiple doses of guanfacine extended-release tablets 4 mg, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 10 ng/mL compared to 7 ng/mL and the AUC was 162 ng·h/mL compared to 116 ng·h/mL in children (ages 6 to 12) and adolescents (ages 13 to 17), respectively. These differences are probably attributable to the lower body weight of children compared to adolescents and adults.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics were affected by intake of food when a single dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets 4 mg was administered with a high-fat breakfast. The mean exposure increased (C<span class="Sub">max</span> ~75% and AUC ~40%) compared to dosing in a fasted state.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dose Proportionality</span></p><p>Following administration of guanfacine extended-release tablets in single doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg to adults, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of guanfacine were proportional to dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP’s demonstrated that guanfacine was primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In pooled human hepatic microsomes, guanfacine did not inhibit the activities of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/5); guanfacine is also not an inducer of CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Guanfacine is a substrate of CYP3A4/5 and exposure is affected by CYP3A4/5 inducers/inhibitors.</p><p>Guanfacine inhibits MATE1 and OCT1, but does not inhibit BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, or MATE2K. Guanfacine is a substrate of OCT1 and OCT2, but not BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2. Concomitant administration of guanfacine with OCT1 substrates might potentially increase the exposure of these OCT1 substrates.</p><p><span class="Bold">Studies in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in children was not assessed. In adult patients with impaired renal function, the cumulative urinary excretion of guanfacine and the renal clearance diminished as renal function decreased.

<li>Five short-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (Studies 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6).</li>
<li>One short-term, placebo-controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (Study 3).</li>
<li>One long-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy maintenance trial (Study 7).</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Studies 1 and 2: Fixed-dose Guanfacine extended-release tablets Monotherapy</span></p><p>Study 1 (301 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended-release tablets (2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 5 weeks (n=345) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Study 2 (304 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 6 weeks (n=324) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. In both studies, randomized patients in 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg dose groups were titrated to their target fixed dose, and continued on the same dose until a dose tapering phase started. The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg. Patients who weighed less than 25 kg were not included in either study. </p><p>Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 5 in Study 1 and up to Week 6 in Study 2).</p><p>The mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended-release tablets compared to placebo for Studies 1 and 2. Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline were statistically significant for each of the 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets randomized treatment groups in both studies, as well as the 1 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets treatment group that was included only in Study 2 (see Table 16). </p><p>Dose-responsive efficacy was evident, particularly when data were examined on a weight-adjusted (mg/kg) basis. When evaluated over the dose range of 0.01 to 0.17 mg/kg/day, clinically relevant improvements were observed beginning at doses in the range 0.05 to 0.08 mg/kg/day. Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg/day were shown to provide additional benefit.</p><p>In the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2), subgroup analyses were performed to identify any differences in response based on gender or age (6 to 12 vs. 13 to 17). Analyses of the primary outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. Analyses by age revealed a statistically significant treatment effect only in the 6 to 12 age subgroup. Due to the relatively small proportion of adolescent patients (ages 13 to 17) enrolled into these studies (approximately 25%), these data may not have been sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the adolescent patients. In these studies, patients were randomized to a fixed dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets rather than optimized by body weight. Therefore, some adolescent patients were randomized to a dose that might have resulted in relatively lower plasma guanfacine concentrations compared to the younger patients. Over half (55%) of the adolescent patients received doses of 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg. In studies in which systematic pharmacokinetic data were obtained, there was a strong inverse correlation between body weight and plasma guanfacine concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 16: Fixed dose Studies</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Study 3: Flexible-dose Guanfacine extended-release tablets as Adjunctive Therapy to Psychostimulants</span></p><p>Study 3 (313 study) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily optimized dosing (morning or evening) with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg), when co-administered with psychostimulants, was evaluated for 8 weeks, in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD, with a sub-optimal response to stimulants (n=455). Patients were started at the 1 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets dose level and were titrated weekly over a 5-week dose-optimization period to an optimal guanfacine extended-release tablets dose not to exceed 4 mg/day based on tolerability and clinical response. The dose was then maintained for a 3-week dose maintenance period before entry to 1 week of dose tapering. Patients took guanfacine extended-release tablets either in the morning or the evening while maintaining their current dose of psychostimulant treatment given each morning. Allowable psychostimulants in the study were ADDERALL XR<span class="Sup">®</span>, VYVANSE<span class="Sup">®</span>, CONCERTA<span class="Sup">®</span>,  FOCALIN XR<span class="Sup">®</span>, RITALIN LA<span class="Sup">®</span>, METADATE CD<span class="Sup">®</span> or FDA-approved generic equivalents. </p><p>Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a weekly basis by clinicians using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales.

Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets showed statistically significantly greater improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with patients receiving placebo (see Table 17).  </p><p>Study 6 (316 study) was a 12-week (for children aged 6 to 12) or 15-week (for adolescents aged 13 to 17), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-reference, dose-optimization study conducted in pediatric patients (children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old inclusive) (n=337) to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing (children: 1 to 4 mg/day, adolescents: 1 to 7 mg/day; optimized dose range of 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine extended-release tablets were statistically superior to placebo on symptoms of ADHD in patients 6 to 17 years as measured by change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total scores (see Table 17).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 17: Flexible-Dose studies</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Study 7: Long-Term Maintenance of Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets Efficacy</span></p><p>Study 7 (315 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study consisted of an open-label phase, including a 7-week dose optimization period to titrate patients to an optimal dose (maximum 4 mg/day for children and 7 mg/day for adolescents; optimized dose range: 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) and a 6-week dose maintenance period. There were 526 patients included in the open-label phase. Among those, 315 patients who met response criteria in the open-label phase were then randomized (1:1, guanfacine extended-release tablets:placebo) in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase. The response criteria were defined by ≥30% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 during the open-label phase. A statistically significantly lower proportion of treatment failures occurred among guanfacine extended-release tablets patients compared to placebo at the end of the randomized withdrawal period (Figure 4). Treatment failure was defined as a ≥50% increase (worsening) in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a ≥2-point increase in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score. Patients who met the treatment failure criteria on two consecutive visits or discontinued for any reason were classified as treatment failure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4.
