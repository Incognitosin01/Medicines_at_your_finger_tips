</ul><h3>Dosage Information</h3><p class="First">For the treatment of moderately active ulcerative colitis, the recommended dosage of</p><p>Zaldyon in adults is 1600 mg (two 800 mg tablets) three times daily (total daily dosage of 4.8 grams) for a duration of 6 weeks.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Zaldyon (mesalamine) delayed-release tablets are available as reddish-brown colored, capsule-shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "435" on one side and plain on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Zaldyon is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to salicylates or aminosalicylates or to any of the ingredients of Zaldyon <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as Zaldyon that contain or are converted to mesalamine <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of Zaldyon and periodically while on therapy. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Zaldyon in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis has been reported in 2.3% of Zaldyon-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of Zaldyon as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when Zaldyon are discontinued.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to Zaldyon or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine.</p><p>As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue Zaldyon if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Hepatic Failure</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Caution should be exercised when administering Zaldyon tablets to patients with liver impairment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most serious adverse reactions seen in Zaldyon clinical trials or with other products that contain mesalamine or are metabolized to mesalamine were:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Renal Impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Hepatic Failure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Zaldyon has been evaluated in 896 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled studies. Three six-week, active-controlled studies were conducted comparing Zaldyon 4.8 grams per day with mesalamine-delayed release tablets 2.4 grams per day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In these studies, 727 patients were dosed with Zaldyon tablets and 732 patients were dosed with mesalamine delayed-release tablets, 400 mg.</p><p>The most common reactions reported in the Zaldyon group were headache (4.7%), nausea (2.8%), nasopharyngitis (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), and dyspepsia (1.7%); Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in the three studies. The most common reactions in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (602 patients dosed with Zaldyon and 618 patients dosed with the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg) were the same as all treated patients.</p><p>Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients in the Zaldyon group and in 4.2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg comparator group. The most common cause for discontinuation was gastrointestinal symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis.</p><p>Serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients in the Zaldyon group and in 1.8% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablet, 400 mg comparator group. The majority involved the gastrointestinal system.</p><p class="First Footnote">N = number of patients within specified treatment group</p><p class="First Footnote">Percent = percentage of patients in category and treatment group</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions reported above in clinical trials involving the</p><p>Zaldyon tablet, the adverse events listed below have been reported in postmarketing experience with other mesalamine-containing products or products that are metabolized to mesalamine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole</span></span></p><p>Facial edema, edema, peripheral edema, asthenia, chills, infection, malaise, pain, neck pain, chest pain, back pain, abdominal enlargement, lupus-like syndrome, drug fever (rare).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span></span></p><p>Pericarditis (rare) and myocarditis (rare) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>], pericardial effusion, vasodilation, migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span></span> Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span></span></p><p>Dry mouth, stomatitis, oral ulcers, anorexia, increased appetite, eructation, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer (rare), constipation, hemorrhoids, rectal hemorrhage, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, stool abnormality.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic</span></span></p><p>There have been rare reports of hepatotoxicity, including jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and possible hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure.

Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h2 class="Bold">7.2 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine</h2><p class="First">The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may increase the risk for blood disorders. If concomitant use of Zaldyon and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h2 class="Bold">8.1 Pregnancy:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies of mesalamine in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose [see <span class="Italics">Data</span>].</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 0.97 times (rat) and 1.95 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose of 4.8 grams per day, based on body surface area.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts [<span class="Italics">see Data</span>]. There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants.</p><p>There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Zaldyon and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></span></p><p>Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the Nacetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Zaldyon in pediatric patients have not been established. See the prescribing information for other approved mesalamine products for the safety and effectiveness of these products in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Zaldyon did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing experience for another oral formulation of mesalamine suggest a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during therapy with Zaldyon.</p><p>In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing Zaldyon <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h2 class="Bold">8.6 Renal Impairment</h2><p class="First">Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on Zaldyon therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose and treatment for suspected acute severe toxicity with Zaldyon should be symptomatic and supportive. This may include prevention of further gastrointestinal tract absorption, correction of fluid electrolyte imbalance, and maintenance of adequate renal function. Zaldyon is a pH dependent delayed-release product and this factor should be considered when treating a suspected overdose.</p><p>Single oral doses of 5000 mg/kg mesalamine suspension in mice (approximately 4.2 times the recommended human dose of Zaldyon based on body surface area), 4595 mg/kg in rats (approximately 7.8 times the recommended human dose of Zaldyon based on body surface area) and 3000 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys (approximately 10 times the recommended human dose of Zaldyon based on body surface area) were lethal.</p><h2>Zaldyon Description</h2><p class="First">Each Zaldyon delayed-release tablet for oral administration contains 800 mg of mesalamine USP, an aminosalicylate. Mesalamine, USP is light tan to pink colored, needle-shaped crystals. Color may darken on exposure to air. It is odorless or may have a slight characteristic odor, slightly soluble in water; very slightly soluble in methanol, in dehydrated alcohol, and in acetone; practically insoluble in n<span class="Italics">-</span>butyl alcohol, in chloroform, in ether, in ethyl acetate, in n-hexane, in methylene chloride, and in n-propyl alcohol and soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid and in dilute alkali hydroxides. Zaldyon have single layered coating consisting of an acrylic based resin Eudragit S (methacrylic acid copolymer B, NF), which dissolves at pH 7 or greater, releasing mesalamine for topical anti-inflammatory action in the colon. Mesalamine (also referred to as 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA) has the chemical name 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and its structural formula is:</p><p>Each Zaldyon (mesalamine) delayed-release tablet contains 800 mg of mesalamine. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: acetyltributyl citrate, colloidal silicone dioxide, ferric oxide red, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer type B, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, talc and titanium dioxide. The tablet is printed with opacode black S-1-17823 which contains following ingredients: ammonium hydroxide, butyl alcohol, ferrosoferric oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and shellac.</p><h2>Zaldyon - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of mesalamine is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Plasma concentrations of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) are highly variable following administration of Zaldyon tablets. Following single dose oral administration of Zaldyon 800 mg tablet in healthy subjects (N = 139) under fasted conditions, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">8-48h</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-tldc</span> values were 208 ng/mL, 2296 ng.h/mL, and 2533 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median [range] Tmax for mesalamine following administration of Zaldyon 800 mg tablet was approximately 24 hours [4 to 72 hours], reflecting the delayed-release characteristics of the formulation.</p><p>Based on cumulative urinary recovery of mesalamine and N-Ac-5-ASA from single dose studies in healthy subjects, approximately 20% of the orally administered mesalamine in Zaldyon is systemically absorbed.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect:</span> A high calorie (800 to 1000 calories), high fat (approximately 50 % of total caloric content) meal increased mesalamine C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 2.4-fold and mesalamine systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">8-48</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-tldc</span>) by 2.8-fold; the median lag-time increased by 8 hours and median t<span class="Sub">max</span> by 6 hours (from 24 to 30 hours) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>Comparative exposure between one Zaldyon 800 mg tablet and two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg oral products is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><p>Elimination</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The absorbed mesalamine is acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver to N-Ac- 5-ASA.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2000 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 0.97 and 2.0 times the 4.8 grams per day Zaldyon dose (based on body surface area). Mesalamine was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 0.97 times the recommended human treatment dose based on body surface area), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h3>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND OR TOXICOLOGY</h3><p class="First">In animal studies (rats, mice, dogs), the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity. (In the following, comparisons of animal dosing to recommended human dosing are based on body surface area and a 4.8 grams per day dose for a 60 kg person).</p><p>Mesalamine causes renal papillary necrosis in rats at single doses of approximately 750 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg (1.5 to 2.0 times the recommended human dose). Doses of 170 and 360 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 and 0.73 times the recommended human dose) given to rats for six months produced papillary necrosis, papillary edema, tubular degeneration, tubular mineralization, and urothelial hyperplasia.</p><p>In mice, oral doses of 4000 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.1 times the recommended human dose) for three months produced tubular nephrosis, multifocal/diffuse tubulo-interstitial inflammation, and multifocal/diffuse papillary necrosis.</p><p>In dogs, single doses of 6000 mg (approximately 6.25 times the recommended human dose) of delayed-release mesalamine tablets resulted in renal papillary necrosis but were not fatal. Renal changes have occurred in dogs given chronic administration of mesalamine at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Zaldyon at 4.8 grams per day was studied in a six-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 772 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). Moderately active UC was defined as a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2; the PGA is a four-point scale (0 to 3) that encompasses the clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy findings.</p><p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to the Zaldyon 4.8 grams per day group (two Zaldyon three times a day) or the mesalamine delayed-release 2.4 grams per day group (two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets three times a day).</p><p>Patients characteristically had a history of previous use of oral 5-ASAs (86%), steroids (41%), and rectal therapies (49%), and demonstrated clinical symptoms of three or more stools over normal per day (87%) and obvious blood in the stool most or all of the time (70%). The study population was primarily Caucasian (97%), had a mean age of 43 years (8% aged 65 years or older), and included slightly more males (56%) than females (44%).</p><p>The primary endpoint was treatment success defined as improvement from baseline to Week 6 based on the PGA. Treatment success rates were similar in the two groups: 70% in the Zaldyon group and 66% in the mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg group (difference: 5%; 95% CI: [-1.9%, 11.2%]).</p><p>A second controlled study supported the efficacy of Zaldyon at 4.8 grams per day. Treatment success was 72% in patients with moderately active UC treated with mesalamine.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Zaldyon (mesalamine) delayed-release Tablets, USP 800 mg are reddish-brown colored, capsule-shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "435" on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 70710-1543-8 in bottles of 180 tablets</p><p>NDC 70710-1543-4 in cartons of 100 tablets (10 x 10 unit-dose)</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Protect from moisture.
