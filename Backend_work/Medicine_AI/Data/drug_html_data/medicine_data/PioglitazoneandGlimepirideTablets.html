</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets</h2><p class="First">Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already treated with a thiazolidinedione and sulfonylurea or who have inadequate glycemic control on a thiazolidinedione alone or a sulfonylurea alone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.</p><p>Use caution in patients with liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span></p><h2>Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommendations for All Patients</h3><p class="First">Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be taken once daily with the first main meal.</p><p>Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets are available as a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablet. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and glimepiride is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>for patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus glimepiride as separate tablets: Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride already being taken,</li>
<li>for patients currently on a different sulfonylurea monotherapy or switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus a different sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide): 30 mg/2 mg once daily and adjusted after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Observe for hypoglycemia for one to two weeks due to the potential overlapping drug effect.</li>
<li>for patients with systolic dysfunction, the lowest approved dose of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be prescribed only after titration from 15 mg to 30 mg of pioglitazone has been safely tolerated.</li>
</ul><p>After initiation of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for hypoglycemia and adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p>Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin</h3><p class="First">If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets and an insulin secretagogue, the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced<span class="Bold">.</span></p><p>If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3 fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If gemfibrozil or other CYP2C8 inhibitors need to co-administered, patients should switch to individual components of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets because the minimum dose of pioglitazone in Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets exceeds 15 mg <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Concomitant Use with Colesevelam</h3><p class="First">When colesevelam is coadministered with glimepiride, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glimepiride is reduced. Therefore, Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be administered at least four hours prior to colesevelam <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.7)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

<li>Use in patients with known history of an allergic reaction to sulfonamide derivatives.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Reported hypersensitivity reactions with glimepiride include cutaneous eruptions with or without pruritus as well as more serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, dyspnea) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Congestive Heart Failure</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets are used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets must be considered <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span>, <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glimepiride</span></p><p>All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, a component of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets, can cause severe hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death.</p><p>Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other antidiabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested.</p><p>Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glimepiride</span></p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, a component of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes.</p><h3>Potential Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glimepiride</span></p><p>The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups.</p><p>UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2.5 times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glimepiride tablets and of alternative modes of therapy.</p><p>Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.</p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be initiated with caution.</p><p>Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.</p><p>Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets can be used with caution.</p><h3>Urinary Bladder Tumors</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer . After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.59–1.72]).</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">A large prospective 10 year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89-1.26]).</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22–2.19]).</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10 year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors.There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Consequently, Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.</span></p><h3>Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.</p><p>Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1),</span> and <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Fractures</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.</p><h3>Hemolytic Anemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glimepiride</span></p><p>Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets contain glimepiride, which belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a nonsulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Macular Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.</p><p>Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione.</p><p>Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in the controlled 16 week clinical studies between placebo plus a sulfonylurea and pioglitazone (15 mg and 30 mg combined) plus sulfonylurea treatment arms were upper respiratory tract infection (15.5% and 16.6%), accidental injury (8.6% and 3.5%), and combined edema/peripheral edema (2.1% and 7.2%), respectively.</p><p>The incidence and type of adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in any combined treatment group from the 24 week study comparing pioglitazone 30 mg plus a sulfonylurea and pioglitazone 45 mg plus a sulfonylurea are shown in Table 1; the rate of adverse events resulting in study discontinuation between the two treatment groups was 6% and 9.7%, respectively.</p><p>In US double-blind studies, anemia was reported in ≤2% of patients treated with pioglitazone plus a sulfonylurea <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years.</p><p>In six pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16 to 24 week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3.0%).</p><p>In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients.

Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. Since the minimum dose of pioglitazone in Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets exceeds 15 mg, patients taking concomitant strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should switch to individual components of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets, unless the prescribing health care provider determines that the benefit of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets clearly outweighs the risk of increased pioglitazone exposure <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>CYP2C8 Inducers</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.

Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act primarily by stimulating release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p>In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.</p><p>Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glimepiride</span></p><p>Glimepiride primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In a 26 week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group.

No changes were observed in warfarin plasma protein binding. Glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin. The reductions in mean area under the prothrombin time (PT) curve and maximum PT values during glimepiride treatment were 3.3% and 9.9%, respectively, and are unlikely to be clinically relevant.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Colesevelam</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of colesevelam and glimepiride resulted in reductions in glimepiride AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 18% and 8%, respectively. When glimepiride was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was not significant change in glimepiride AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, -6% and 3%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.7)]</span>.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No animal studies have been conducted with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with pioglitazone or glimepiride individually.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>A two year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats at oral doses up to 63 mg/kg (approximately 14 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 45 mg based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Drug-induced tumors were not observed in any organ except for the urinary bladder of male rats. Benign and/or malignant transitional cell neoplasms were observed in male rats at 4 mg/kg/day and above (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia were postulated as the mechanism for bladder tumors observed in male rats. A two year mechanistic study in male rats utilizing dietary acidification to reduce calculi formation was completed in 2009. Dietary acidification decreased but did not abolish the hyperplastic changes in the bladder. The presence of calculi exacerbated the hyperplastic response to pioglitazone but was not considered the primary cause of the hyperplastic changes.</p><p>The relevance to humans of the bladder findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.</p><p>A two-year carcinogenicity study was also conducted in male and female mice at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No drug-induced tumors were observed in any organ.</p><p>Pioglitazone hydrochloride was not mutagenic in a battery of genetic toxicology studies, including the Ames bacterial assay, a mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay (CHO/HPRT and AS52/XPRT), an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetics assay using CHL cells, an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay.</p><p>No adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg pioglitazone hydrochloride daily prior to and throughout mating and gestation (approximately nine times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glimepiride</span></p><p>Studies in rats at doses of up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) in complete feed (approximately 340 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on surface area) for 30 months showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. In mice, administration of glimepiride for 24 months resulted in an increase in benign pancreatic adenoma formation that was dose-related and was thought to be the result of chronic pancreatic stimulation. No adenoma formation in mice was observed at a dose of 320 ppm in complete feed, or 46 – 54 mg/kg body weight/day. This is about 35 times the maximum human recommended dose of 8 mg once daily based on surface area.</p><p>Glimepiride was non-mutagenic in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mutagenicity studies (Ames test, somatic cell mutation, chromosomal aberration, unscheduled DNA synthesis and mouse micronucleus test).</p><p>There was no effect of glimepiride on male mouse fertility in animals exposed up to 2500 mg/kg body weight (&gt;1,700 times the maximum recommended human dose based on surface area). Glimepiride had no effect on the fertility of male and female rats administered up to 4000 mg/kg body weight (approximately 4,000 times the maximum recommended human dose based on surface area).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Heart enlargement has been observed in mice (100 mg/kg), rats (4 mg/kg and above), and dogs (3 mg/kg) treated orally with the pioglitazone hydrochloride component of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets (approximately 11, one, and two times the maximum recommended human oral dose for mice, rats, and dogs, respectively, based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). In a one year rat study, drug-related early death due to apparent heart dysfunction occurred at an oral dose of 160 mg/kg/day (approximately 35 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Heart enlargement was seen in a 13 week study in monkeys at oral doses of 8.9 mg/kg and above (approximately four times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), but not in a 52 week study at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg (approximately 13 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">There have been no clinical efficacy studies conducted with Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets. However, the efficacy and safety of the separate components have been previously established. The coadministration of pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea, including glimepiride, has been evaluated for efficacy and safety in two clinical studies. These clinical studies established an added benefit of pioglitazone in glycemic control of patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes while on sulfonylurea therapy. Bioequivalence of Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets with coadministered Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets was demonstrated at the 30 mg/2 mg and 30 mg/4 mg dosage strengths <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Two clinical trials were conducted with pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea. Both studies included patients with type 2 diabetes on any dose of a sulfonylurea, either alone or in combination with another antidiabetic agent. All other antidiabetic agents were withdrawn at least three weeks prior to starting study treatment.</p><p>In the first study, 560 patients were randomized to receive 15 mg or 30 mg of pioglitazone or placebo once daily for 16 weeks in addition to their current sulfonylurea regimen. Treatment with pioglitazone as add-on to sulfonylurea produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and FGP at endpoint compared to placebo add-on to sulfonylurea <span class="Italics">(Table 15)</span>.</p><p>In the second trial, 702 patients were randomized to receive 30 mg or 45 mg of pioglitazone once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their current sulfonylurea regimen. The mean reduction from baseline at Week 24 in HbA1c was 1.6% for the 30 mg dose and 1.7% for the 45 mg dose <span class="Italics">(see Table 16)</span>. The mean reduction from baseline at Week 24 in FPG was 52 mg/dL for the 30 mg dose and 56 mg/dL for the 45 mg dose.</p><p>The therapeutic effect of pioglitazone in combination with sulfonylurea was observed in patients regardless of the sulfonylurea dose.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Pioglitazone and Glimepiride Tablets are available in 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablets as follows:</p><p>30 mg/2 mg tablet: white to off-white, round, convex tablets, debossed with 4833G on one side and 30/2 on the other, available in:</p><p>NDC 66993-821-30 Bottles of 30</p><p>30 mg/4 mg tablet: white to off-white, round, convex tablets, debossed with 4833G on one side and 30/4 on the other, available in:</p><p>NDC 66993-822-30 Bottles of 30</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
