Fibrinogen is the main component of the sealant solution. The solution also contains thrombin, which transforms fibrinogen from the sealer protein solution into fibrin, and fibrinolysis inhibitor (aprotinin), which prevents the premature degradation of fibrin. When mixed as directed, a viscous solution forms that sets into an elastic coagulum. Patches contain fibrinogen and thrombin  that, in contact with bleeding surfaces, hydrate, form active fibrin, then produce a fibrin clot.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Artiss: Full adherence achieved: ~2 hours</p><p>Time to hemostasis: Evarrest: 4 minutes; Evicel: 4 to 10 minutes; Raplixa: 5 minutes; TachoSil: 3 to 6 minutes; Tisseel: 5 minutes</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Colonic anastomosis sealing (Tisseel only):</b> As an adjunct to standard surgical techniques (such as suture and ligature) to prevent leakage from colonic anastomoses following the reversal of temporary colostomies</p><p><b>Facial rhytidectomy (Artiss only):</b> To adhere tissue flaps during facial rhytidectomy surgery (face lift)</p><p><b>Hemostasis, adjunct:</b></p><p>Artiss: Not indicated as an adjunct to hemostasis</p><p>Evarrest, Evicel: As an adjunct to hemostasis for use in patients undergoing surgery when control of bleeding by conventional surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, and cautery) is ineffective or impractical</p><p>Raplixa: As an adjunct to hemostasis for mild to moderate bleeding in adults undergoing surgery when control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, and cautery) is ineffective or impractical</p><p>TachoSil: As an adjunct to hemostasis for use with manual compression in adults and pediatric patients ≥1 month in cardiovascular and hepatic surgery when control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, or cautery) is ineffective or impractical</p><p>Tisseel: As an adjunct to hemostasis in adult and pediatric patients (≥1 month) undergoing surgery when control of bleeding by conventional surgical techniques, including suture, ligature, and cautery, is ineffective or impractical.

Draw up equal volumes of each vial into application device.</p><p><b>Raplixa:</b> RaplixaSpray device (refer to absorbable gelatin sponge and RaplixaSpray device manufacturer's labeling for detailed instructions): To attach the vial to the RaplixaSpray device, invert the device and place the upright vial into the gray rubber ring on the device then turn the device upright. Activate air or gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) flow. Do not push spray device operating button until ready for administration. Pressure should be 1.5 bar (22 psi) and vial should be kept within 45º of vertical. Spray nozzle should be a minimum of 5 cm (or 2 inches) from the bleeding site.</p><p><b>Tisseel kit, powder for solution:</b> Store at 2°C to 25°C (35°F to 77°F); do not freeze. Prior to reconstitution, all 4 vials (sealer protein concentrate, fibrinolysis inhibitor solution, thrombin, calcium chloride solution) from the kit should be placed into the prewarmed wells of Baxter's Fibrinotherm heating and stirring device and allowed to warm for up to 5 minutes. Do not expose to temperatures &gt;37°C (&gt;98.6°F) during preparation. When disinfecting the rubber stoppers of vials during reconstitution, do <b>NOT</b> use a germicidal solution that contains iodine or heavy metals (eg, Betadine). Allow alcohol-based disinfectants to evaporate before puncturing the stopper.</p><p><i>To reconstitute the sealer protein:</i> Transfer the fibrinolysis inhibitor solution into the vial of the freeze dried sealer protein concentrate. Use the appropriate adapter to insert the vial into the largest opening of the Fibrinotherm. Turn on the stirring switch of the Fibrinotherm and stir contents until all sealer protein concentrate has dissolved. If total dissolution has not occurred within 20 minutes, discard and prepare a fresh kit. If not used promptly, keep the solution at 37°C (98.6°F) without stirring. Stir again shortly before drawing up solution.</p><p><i>To reconstitute the thrombin:</i> Add the calcium chloride to the thrombin vial. Swirl briefly. Allow complete dissolution of thrombin concentrate. Place vial into the adapted opening of the Fibrinotherm device. Keep the prepared solution at 37°C (98.6°F) until use.</p><p><i>Preparation of the final solution: </i> Prior to application, the sealer protein solution and the thrombin solution should be transferred to a sterile field. To do this, the scrub nurse should withdraw the solution into the provided syringes, while the circulating nurse holds the vials. Withdraw solutions slowly to reduce the possible formation of large air bubbles. The two resulting solutions are then placed into the Duploject Preparation and Application syringe system (provided in the kit) or an equivalent device. Tisseel application must be completed within 4 hours of preparing the solution.</p><p><b>Artiss prefilled syringe, Tisseel prefilled syringe:</b> Prior to use, product should be completely thawed and warmed to 33°C to 37°C (91°F to 98.6°F). Product may be thawed per manufacturer's guidelines using either room temperature thawing or a quick thawing method (water bath or incubator); do not microwave. Do not remove protective syringe cap until fully thawed and warmed. Tisseel application must be completed within 4 hours of opening the package. Artiss must be used within 12 hours after warming or removal from pouch. Do not refrigerate or refreeze after thawing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Artiss: Prior to use, dry application site using standard techniques (eg, intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices); do not use pressurized air or gas for drying the site. Apply only to application sites that are visible using a painting motion from side to side in a thin layer to dry wound surface using EasySpray and Spray set or an equivalent device cleared by FDA (areas covered with fibrin sealant will appear to “glisten”); do not use EasySpray and Spray set system in enclosed body cavities. Immediately after spraying fibrin sealant, attach flap or skin graft; approximate time available for manipulation/positioning is 60 seconds. Hold graft in position with gentle compression for at least 3 minutes; full adherence is achieved in ~2 hours. To prevent sealant from adhering to gloves, wet them with saline prior to contact. The cannulas included with the application system may be used for small wounds or for edges of a skin graft that did not adhere to the wound bed. Immediately before application, expel and discard the first several drops from the application cannula to ensure adequate mixing of the sealer protein and thrombin solutions. Cannulas may become clogged if application is interrupted; replace cannula immediately prior to resuming application; if Y connector is clogged, use provided spare piece.</p><p>Evarrest: For topical use only; apply to surface of bleeding site only. Prior to applying, remove excess blood or fluid from the site of application to improve visibility. The anatomic location and surface area of the bleeding should be used to determine how many patches should be applied. Patches can be cut to shape and size; ensure an overlap of about 0.5 to 1 inch. The active, powdery side of the patch should be applied to the tissue or prosthetic graft. Immediate, continuous manual compression using dry or moist laparotomy pads or surgical gauze should be applied evenly to the entire surface of the patch and continuous contact pressure should be held for 3 minutes.</p><p>Evicel: For topical use only; apply to surface of bleeding tissue only; do not inject directly into the circulatory system or into tissues. Prior to applying, dry surface areas of wound and remove excess blood from site of application by standard techniques (eg, intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices).</p><p>Application by 4 cm control tip by drip method: Bend tip to desired position (tip will retain shape); keep tip of applicator as close as possible to the tissue surface without touching during application. Apply solution to surface area to be treated; as soon as solution is applied, pull back tip from treated area surface immediately. Control coverage area by varying applied force on plunger and tip distance from tissue.</p><p>Application by 6 cm, 35 cm, and 45 cm tips by spray or drip methods: Solution should be sprayed or dripped in short bursts (0.1 to 0.2 mL) on the tissue to produce an even, thin layer. Application with provided device allows for the simultaneous application of both solutions. Apply spray with provided air tube; distance between nozzle and tissue surface should be 10 to 15 cm for open surgery or 4 to 10 cm for laparoscopic surgery. Apply drops keeping applicator close to, but not touching tissue surface.</p><p>Application by airless spray accessory: Once airless spray accessory (no connection to an external CO<sub>2</sub> source) is firmly attached, do not press plungers to prime device until intended use because the two biologic components will premix in spray tip forming a fibrin clot that prevents dispensing. Position tip at least 2 cm away from the target tissue; increase distance accordingly to achieve desired coverage of target area. Replace spray tip if any pause in expression; do not try and clear fibrin clot within tip by depressing plunger.</p><p>Raplixa: For topical use only.</p><p>Direct application (refer to absorbable gelatin sponge labeling for detailed instructions): Remove vial stopper and sprinkle a thin layer of powder onto the bleeding site OR sprinkle a thin layer of powder onto a pre-wetted gelatin sponge and place onto the bleeding site; apply gentle pressure with gelatin sponge using sterile gauze.</p><p>RaplixaSpray device (refer to absorbable gelatin sponge and RaplixaSpray device manufacturer's labeling for detailed instructions): To attach the vial to the RaplixaSpray device, invert the device and place the upright vial into the gray rubber ring on the device then turn the device upright. Activate air or gas flow. Do not push spray device operating button until ready for administration. Pressure should be 1.5 bar (22 psi) and vial should be kept within 45º of vertical. Spray nozzle should be a minimum of 5 cm (or 2 inches) from the bleeding site. Apply within 10 to 60 seconds; powder should cover bleeding surface as a thin layer. Place a gelatin sponge (trimmed to appropriate size) on top of the powder immediately after application; sponge may be dry or moistened with sterile saline (moistened sponge molds better to contoured bleeding areas); apply manual pressure to gelatin sponge with sterile gauze. After application, remove empty vial by holding the device upside down. No more than 2 vials may be used with a single RaplixaSpray device; to use a third vial, open a new RaplixaSpray delivery device.</p><p>TachoSil: The outer aluminum foil pouch may be opened in a nonsterile environment; the inner sterile blister <b>must</b> be opened in a sterile environment. Adequately cleanse tissue areas outside the desired application area to prevent tissue adhesions at undesired sites. Apply the yellow, active side directly to the bleeding tissue (extending 1 to 2 cm beyond margins of wound) either wet or dry. If applied wet, premoisten patch in NS for ≤1 minute, then apply immediately. After applying, hold in place with gentle compression through moistened gloves or moistened pad for at least 3 minutes. To prevent inactive side of patch from adhering to pad or gloves, place a clean surgical instrument at one end of the patch prior to relieving pressure; area may also be moistened with saline solution. Once patch adheres, leave in place. Handle unattached patches with care and replace with new patches. The application procedure may be repeated if bleeding continues during or after the compression period, but do not remove applied patches. Document product batch number(s) in patient record.</p><p>Tisseel: Apply in thin layers (by dripping or spraying using a cannula or spray set) to avoid excess formation of granulation tissue and slow absorption of the sealant. When using a spray device, use the ranges of gas, pressure, and distance from tissue recommended in the manufacturer's labeling. Following application, hold the sealed parts in the desired position for 3 to 5 minutes. If repeat application is necessary, dry the site as much as possible before reapplying. To prevent sealant from adhering to gloves or surgical instruments, wet them with saline prior to contact. In cases where very small volumes (1 to 2 drops) are required, expel and discard the first several drops from the application cannula to ensure adequate mixing of the sealer protein and thrombin solutions. Cannulas may become clogged if application is interrupted; replace cannula immediately prior to resuming application; if Y connector is clogged, use provided spare piece.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p><b>Evarrest</b> Store unopened packages at 2°C to 25°C (35°F to 77°F); do not refrigerate; do not freeze.

Do not use in place of sutures or other forms of mechanical ligation in treatment of major arterial or venous bleeding. Do not apply to active infections or contaminated areas (risk for infection). Not for use in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone or areas of bony confine where swelling may cause nerve or blood vessel compression. Use may result in inadvertent adhesion. Not for use in laparoscopic and other minimally invasive surgeries where manual compression would be difficult to achieve. Do not use to treat bleeding from defects in large arteries or veins where the injured vascular wall requires conventional surgical repair for maintenance of vessel patency or where there would be persistent exposure of fibrin sealant to blood flow and/or pressure during absorption of the product.</p><p>• TachoSil patch: May contain collagen, which may adhere to bleeding surfaces. Adhesion to GI tissues leading to GI obstruction have been reported with use during abdominal surgery. Do not apply or leave product in an infected or contaminated space due to potential for infection exacerbation. Do not over-pack when applying product in closed spaces or cavities; may compress underlying tissue. Do not use in place of sutures or other forms of mechanical ligation in treatment of major arterial or venous bleeding. Adequately cleanse tissue areas outside the desired application area to prevent tissue adhesions at undesired sites. Use the minimum amount of patches necessary; excess patch material may (theoretically) become dislodged and migrate to other areas of the body. Thrombosis can occur if applied intravascularly; apply only to surface of vascular, cardiac, or hepatic tissue.</p><p>• Tisseel: May contain aprotinin (synthetic source). Do not use with oxycellulose-containing preparations; may decrease efficacy. Safety and efficacy in neurologic procedures (or other procedures within a confined space) have not been established.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Administration: For topical use only; do not inject or apply intravascularly; inadvertent intravascular administration may result in serious or life-threatening thromboembolic or allergic/anaphylactoid reaction. Use only the minimum amount necessary; excessive use may decrease efficacy and interfere with wound healing. Air or gas embolism, tissue rupture, or gas entrapment with compression (may be life threatening) has occurred when using spray devices with pressure regulators to apply fibrin sealants; risk of embolism appears to be related to using higher than recommended pressures, administering closer than the recommended distance from tissue surface, or when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared with CO<sub>2</sub>. Use only with product-recommended regulators, pressure ranges, and applicator positions. Patches are not for use as substitutes for sutures or any mechanical ligation in major vessel bleeding. Do not use Evarrest or TachoSil patches in children &lt;1 month of age (application is limited due to size).</p><p>• Alcohol, iodine, or heavy-metal ions: Exposure to any of these solutions may denature fibrinogen and thrombin proteins; if any were used, thoroughly rinse area before applying fibrin sealant.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> when spraying (due to the possibility of gas embolism); hypersensitivity reactions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. </p><h2>More about fibrin sealant topical</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
