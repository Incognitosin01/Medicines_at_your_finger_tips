</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been shown to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric and young adult patients when used to treat major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Because Paroxetine Capsules are an SSRI, monitor patients closely for worsening and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Paroxetine Capsules</h2><p class="First">Paroxetine Capsules are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Limitation of Use:</span></span></p><p>Paroxetine Capsules are not indicated for the treatment of any psychiatric condition. Paroxetine Capsules contain a lower dose of paroxetine than that used to treat depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The safety and efficacy of this lower dose of paroxetine in Paroxetine Capsules have not been established for any psychiatric condition. Patients who require paroxetine for treatment of a psychiatric condition should discontinue Paroxetine Capsules and initiate a paroxetine-containing medication that is indicated for such use.</p><h2>Paroxetine Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage Information</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Paroxetine Capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS is 7.5 mg once daily, at bedtime, with or without food.</p><h3>Use of Paroxetine Capsules Before or After a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI)</h3><p class="First">Wait at least 14 days after discontinuation of an MAOI before initiating therapy with Paroxetine Capsules. Conversely, allow at least 14 days after stopping Paroxetine Capsules before starting an MAOI <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Paroxetine Capsules are available as 7.5 mg pink capsules printed with black edible ink with “BRISDELLE” and “7.5 mg” on the capsule. Each capsule contains 9.69 mg paroxetine mesylate equivalent to 7.5 mg paroxetine base.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of an MAOI with Paroxetine Capsules or within 14 days of stopping treatment with Paroxetine Capsules is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of Paroxetine Capsules within 14 days of stopping an MAOI is also contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><p>Starting Paroxetine Capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, both of which inhibit monoamine oxidase, is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Thioridazine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of Paroxetine Capsules with thioridazine is contraindicated, because thioridazine prolongs the QT interval, and paroxetine can increase thioridazine levels <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pimozide</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of Paroxetine Capsules with pimozide is contraindicated because pimozide prolongs the QT interval, and paroxetine increases pimozide levels <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity to any Ingredient in Paroxetine Capsules</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine Capsules are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to paroxetine or any of the other ingredients in Paroxetine Capsules.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Menopausal VMS does not occur during pregnancy and Paroxetine Capsules may cause fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine Capsules are not approved for any psychiatric condition.</p><p>Antidepressants, including those that contain an SSRI, increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in pediatric and young adult patients when used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. There is limited information regarding suicidality in women who use Paroxetine Capsules for treatment of VMS. The paroxetine capsule trials excluded women with a presence or history of previous psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Consider discontinuing Paroxetine Capsules in patients with worsening depression or those who experience emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with Paroxetine Capsules should be observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of treatment.</span></p><p>Anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with Paroxetine Capsules should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers.</span></p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs, including paroxetine, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat depression and others such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.</p><p>The concomitant use of Paroxetine Capsules with MAOIs is contraindicated. Do not start Paroxetine Capsules in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Paroxetine Capsules. Paroxetine Capsules should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>If concomitant use of Paroxetine Capsules with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) is clinically warranted, consider the increased risk of serotonin syndrome and carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Discontinue Paroxetine Capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above events occur and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment.</span></p><h3>Potential Impact on Tamoxifen Efficacy</h3><p class="First">It is uncertain whether the co-administration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, weigh the likely benefit of Paroxetine Capsules for treating VMS vs. the risk of possible decreased tamoxifen effectiveness, and consider avoiding the concomitant use of Paroxetine Capsules for VMS treatment.</p><h3>Abnormal Bleeding</h3><p class="First">SSRIs, including Paroxetine Capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Caution patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine Capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressants and Paroxetine Capsules may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including Paroxetine Capsules. Elderly patients may be at greater risk. In many cases, the hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported in patients using SSRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are volume-depleted can be at greater risk. Consider discontinuation of Paroxetine Capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and institute appropriate medical intervention.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk following exposure to SSRIs have reported an association between SSRI treatment and fractures. It is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. If a paroxetine capsule-treated patient presents with unexplained bone pain, point tenderness, swelling, or bruising, consider the possibility of a fragility fracture.</p><h3>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder and Monitoring for Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine Capsules are only indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS and are not approved for use in treating either depression or bipolar depression. However, prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine Capsules, all patients should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that use of an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">In premarketing testing of paroxetine, seizures occurred in 0.1% of paroxetine-treated patients. Use Paroxetine Capsules cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Evaluate and consider discontinuing use in any patient who develops seizures.</p><h3>Akathisia</h3><p class="First">The use of paroxetine or other SSRIs has been associated with the development of akathisia, which is characterized by an inner sense of restlessness and psychomotor agitation such as an inability to sit or stand still usually associated with subjective distress. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. Discontinue treatment with Paroxetine Capsules if akathisia occurs.</p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine Capsules have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot directly be compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to Paroxetine Capsules in the one 8-week Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial and the two Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week and 24-week trials for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. In these trials, a total of 635 women were exposed to Paroxetine Capsules 7.5 mg administered orally once daily and 641 women received placebo. The majority of paroxetine capsule-treated patients were Caucasian (68%) and African American (30%), with a mean age of 55 years (range 40 to 73 years). Women with a history of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior were excluded from these studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation:</span> A total of 4.7% of women taking Paroxetine Capsules discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction, compared to 3.7% of women on placebo; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation among paroxetine-treated women were: abdominal pain (0.3%), attention disturbances (0.3%), headache (0.3%), and suicidal ideation (0.3%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Reactions:</span> Overall, based on investigators’ determinations about what events were likely to be drug-related, about 20% of women treated with Paroxetine Capsules reported at least 1 adverse reaction in the three controlled studies. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% and more common among paroxetine capsule-treated women) reported in these studies were headache, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, and nausea/vomiting. Of these commonly reported adverse reactions, nausea occurred primarily within the first 4 weeks of treatment and fatigue occurred primarily within the first week of treatment, and decreased in frequency with continued therapy.</p><p>The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in the paroxetine capsule group and at a higher incidence than placebo are shown in Table 1 for the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1 Frequency of Adverse Reactions in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 Trials (≥ 2% and at a higher incidence than placebo)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Frequency n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Paroxetine Capsules (n=635)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo (n=641)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous system disorders</span></p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">40 (6.3)</p><p class="First">31 (4.8)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General disorders and administration site conditions</span></p><p class="First">Fatigue, malaise, lethargy</p><p class="First">31 (4.9)</p><p class="First">18 (2.8)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></p><p class="First">Nausea, vomiting</p><p class="First">27 (4.3)</p><p class="First">15 (2.3)</p><p>Certain symptoms were seen more frequently in women at the time of discontinuation of Paroxetine Capsules compared to women discontinuing placebo, and have also been reported upon discontinuation of other formulations of paroxetine, particularly when abrupt. These include increased dreaming/nightmares, muscle cramps/spasms/twitching, headache, nervousness/anxiety, fatigue/tiredness, restless feeling in legs, and trouble sleeping/insomnia. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms with other formulations of paroxetine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Reactions:</span> In the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, three paroxetine capsule-treated patients reported a serious adverse reaction of suicidal ideation and one paroxetine-treated patient reported a serious adverse reaction of suicide attempt. There were no serious adverse reactions of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt reported among the placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified from clinical studies of paroxetine and during post-approval use of other formulations of paroxetine. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Events related to impaired hematopoiesis (including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, agranulocytosis).</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Disorders:</span> Atrial fibrillation, Pulmonary edema, Ventricular fibrillation, Ventricular tachycardia (including torsades de pointes).</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> Pancreatitis, Pancreatitis hemorrhagic, Vomiting.</p><p><span class="Bold">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> Death, Drug withdrawal syndrome, Malaise.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatobiliary Disorders:</span> Drug-induced liver injury, Hepatic failure, Jaundice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders:</span> Anaphylactoid reaction, Angioedema, Toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Investigations:</span> Elevated liver tests (the most severe cases were deaths due to liver necrosis, and grossly elevated transaminases associated with severe liver dysfunction).</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span> Diabetes mellitus inadequate control, Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous System Disorders:</span> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, Paresthesia, Somnolence, Tremor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> Aggression, Agitation, Anxiety, Confusional state, Depression, Disorientation, Homicidal ideation, Insomnia, Restlessness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> Pulmonary hypertension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> Hyperhidrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with Paroxetine Capsules.</p><h3>Potential for Paroxetine Capsules to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.

Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy may have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Cardiac malformations are a common congenital abnormality. These data would suggest that the risk of a cardiac abnormality following paroxetine exposure in the first trimester may increase the risk from 1% to 2%. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). No teratogenicity was seen in reproductive development studies conducted in rats and rabbits. However, an increase in rat pup deaths was seen during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation, at a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for VMS (7.5 mg) on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.</p><p>Human Data</p><p><span class="Bold">First-Trimester Pregnancy Exposure</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Third-Trimester Pregnancy Exposure</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 65 (rat) and 16 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for VMS on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There were no teratogenic effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately equal to the MRHD for VMS on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Paroxetine Capsules, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established; Paroxetine Capsules are not indicated in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Paroxetine Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may have elevated paroxetine plasma concentrations compared to younger patients. However, no paroexetine capsules dose adjustment is considered necessary in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>SSRIs have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No Paroxetine Capsules dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No Paroxetine Capsules dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with liver impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Experience with Overdosage</h3><p class="First">There is limited clinical experience with Paroxetine Capsules overdosage in humans, as there were no overdoses reported in the clinical studies.</p><p>Spontaneous cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage during paroxetine treatment have been reported; some of these cases were fatal and some of the fatalities appeared to involve paroxetine alone. Of nonfatal cases with known outcome, most recovered without sequelae. The largest known ingestion involved 2000 mg of paroxetine (267 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who recovered.</p><p>Commonly reported adverse reactions associated with paroxetine overdosage include somnolence, coma, nausea, tremor, tachycardia, confusion, vomiting, and dizziness. Other notable signs and symptoms observed with overdoses involving paroxetine (alone or with other substances) include mydriasis, convulsions (including status epilepticus), ventricular dysrhythmias (including torsades de pointes), hypertension, aggressive reactions, syncope, hypotension, stupor, bradycardia, dystonia, rhabdomyolysis, symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, jaundice, hepatitis, and hepatic steatosis), serotonin syndrome, manic reactions, myoclonus, acute renal failure, and urinary retention.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any SSRI. Consult with a certified poison control center for up-to-date guidance and advice on treatment of overdosage.</p><p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement.</p><h2>Paroxetine Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Paroxetine is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause.

Paroxetine Capsules are not an estrogen, and its mechanism of action for the treatment of VMS is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>-, beta-adrenergic-, dopamine (D<span class="Sub">2</span>)-, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span>-, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2</span>-, and histamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>)-receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Paroxetine is completely absorbed after oral dosing of the mesylate salt. In a study in which healthy postmenopausal women (n=24) received paroxetine 7.5 mg capsules as a daily dose for 14 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 12 days of dosing for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. Peak concentrations were reached at a median of 6 hours (3 to 8 hours range). Steady-state mean values of C<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span>, and AUC<span class="Sub">0-last</span> were 13.10 ng/mL (CV 91%), 7.17 ng/mL (CV 99%), and 237 hr*ng/mL (CV 94%), respectively.</p><p>Steady-state AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> values were about 3 times those of AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> following a single dose, indicating non-linear pharmacokinetics. Steady-state Cmax values were approximately 5 times greater than those attained after a single dose and steady-state exposure based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> was about 10 times greater than AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> after a single dose.</p><p>The nonlinear kinetics and excess accumulation are due to the fact that CYP2D6, an enzyme that is in part responsible for paroxetine metabolism, is readily saturable.</p><p>The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied with paroxetine tablets at higher strength. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours. Paroxetine Capsules can be taken with or without food.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the central nervous system, with only 1% remaining in the plasma.</p><p>Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 100 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by cytochrome CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P450 isozymes, which, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% of the dose was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Renal and Liver Impairment</span></p><p>Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The mean plasma concentration in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min was approximately 4 times greater than seen in normal volunteers. Patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min and patients with hepatic impairment had about a 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations (AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span>). No Paroxetine Capsules dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elderly Patients</span></p><p>In a multiple-dose study in the elderly at daily paroxetine doses of 20, 30, and 40 mg, C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations were about 70% to 80% greater than the respective C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations in nonelderly subjects. No Paroxetine Capsules dose adjustment is considered necessary in elderly patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Potential Effect of Paroxetine Capsules on Other Drugs</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4</span></p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug interaction study involving the co-administration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for CYP3A4, including astemizole, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ki and its lack of effect on terfenadine’s <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span></p><p>Many drugs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6.
