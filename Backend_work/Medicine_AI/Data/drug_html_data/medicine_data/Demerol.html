Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF DEMEROL CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</b></p><p>Demerol <b>tablets</b> are taken by mouth.</p><p>Demerol <b>injection</b> is given as an infusion into a vein, or injected into a muscle or under the skin. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Do not stop using this medicine suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.
