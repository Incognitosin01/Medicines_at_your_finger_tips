Revised: September 2017<br/>
<span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span><br/>
Ambator Lidocaine Patch 5% is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5% lidocaine, which is<br/>
applied to a white non-woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) material backing and covered with a<br/>
transparent PET release liner. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The<br/>
size of the patch is 12.5 cm x 8.5 cm.<br/>
Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an<br/>
octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure:</p><p>Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It<br/>
also contains the following inactive ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe Vera Gel) Juice, Aqua<br/>
(Purified water), Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Boswellia Serrata Extract, Camellia Sinensis<br/>
(Green Tea) Leaf Extract, DihydroxyaluminumAminoacetate, Glycerol, Kaolin, Methyl Paraben,<br/>
Polyacrylic Acid, Polysorbate-80, Propyl Paraben, Propylene Glycol, PVP, Sodium Polyacrylate,<br/>
Tartaric Acid, Titanium Dioxide.</p><p><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span><br/>
Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes<br/>
by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses.<br/>
The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of lidocaine patch is sufficient to<br/>
produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory<br/>
block.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>Absorption:<br/>
The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch is directly related to both the<br/>
duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study,<br/>
three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm2 of intact skin on the back of normal<br/>
volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration<br/>
during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in<br/>
Table 1.<br/>

time)</p><p><span class="Bold">Lidocaine Patch</span></p><p>Application<br/>

0.13 ± 0.06 11 hr</p><p>When lidocaine patch is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 ± 2% of the<br/>
dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used<br/>
patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the<br/>
therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three<br/>
patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days,<br/>
indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma<br/>
pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three<br/>
lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15).</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span><br/>
When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is<br/>
0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 ± 0.6 SD, n=15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine<br/>
patch, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid<br/>
glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein<br/>
binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain<br/>
barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span>:<br/>
It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the<br/>
liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide<br/>
(GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine.<br/>
A minor metabolite, 2, 6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats.<br/>
The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch<br/>
5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36%<br/>
and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion:</span><br/>
Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted<br/>
unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81<br/>
to 149 minutes (mean 107 ± 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64<br/>
± 0.18 SD, n = 15).</p><p><span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span><br/>
Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without<br/>
lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with<br/>
35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated<br/>
periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch performed statistically better than vehicle patch in<br/>
terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours.<br/>
Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch was compared to vehicle patch (without<br/>
lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32<br/>
patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch prior to the<br/>
study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli<br/>
(dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch were observed in<br/>
terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value &lt;0.001), daily average pain<br/>
relief, and patient’s preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication<br/>
commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant<br/>
medication was similar in the two treatment groups.</p><p><span class="Bold">INDICATION AND USAGE</span><br/>
Ambator Lidocaine Patch is for the temporary relief of pain associated with minor cuts, minor<br/>
burns, scrapes and minor skin irritations.</p><p><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p>Ambator LidocainePatch is contraindicated in patients with a known history of sensitivity to local<br/>
anesthetics of the amide type, or to any other component of the product.</p><p><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span></p><p>Accidental Exposure in Children<br/>
Even a used Ambator Lidocaine Patch contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The<br/>
potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or<br/>
ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch, although the risk with this formulation has not been<br/>
evaluated. It is important for patients to <span class="Bold">store and dispose of Ambator LidocainePatch out of the</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">reach of children, pets and others. (See HANDLING AND DISPOSAL)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Excessive Dosing</span><br/>
Excessive dosing by applying Ambator LidocainePatch to larger areas or for longer than the<br/>
recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood<br/>
concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions).<br/>
Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood<br/>
concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer<br/>
duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller<br/>
patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of<br/>
lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is<br/>
about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some<br/>
individuals.</p><p><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p><span class="Bold">General</span><br/>
Hepatic Disease: Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood<br/>
concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally.<br/>
Allergic Reactions: Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine,<br/>
benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should<br/>
be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic<br/>
agent is uncertain.<br/>
Non-intact Skin: Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher<br/>
blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended<br/>
for use on intact skin.<br/>
External Heat Sources: Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric<br/>
blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may<br/>
increase plasma lidocaine levels.<br/>
Eye Exposure: The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided<br/>
based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye<br/>
contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until<br/>
sensation returns.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span><br/>
Antiarrhythmic Drugs: Ambator LidocainePatch should be used with caution in patients receiving<br/>
Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are<br/>
additive and potentially synergistic.<br/>
Local Anesthetics: When Ambator LidocainePatch is used concomitantly with other products containing<br/>
local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.</p><p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<br/>
Carcinogenesis: A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The<br/>
blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of Ambator<br/>
LidocainePatch.<br/>
Mutagenesis: Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic<br/>
in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test.<br/>
Impairment of Fertility: The effect of Ambator LidocainePatch on fertility has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span><br/>
Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Ambator LidocainePatch has not been studied in<br/>
pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg<br/>
subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are,<br/>
however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction<br/>
studies are not always predictive of human response, Ambator LidocainePatch should be used during<br/>
pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Labor and Delivery<br/>
Ambator LidocainePatch has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated<br/>
in labor and delivery. Should Ambator LidocainePatch be used concomitantly with other products<br/>
containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered.</p><p>Nursing Mothers<br/>
Ambator LidocainePatch has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human<br/>
milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when Ambator<br/>
LidocainePatch is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p>Pediatric Use<br/>
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Application Site Reactions</span><br/>
During or immediately after treatment with Ambator LidocainePatch, the skin at the site of<br/>
application may develop blisters, bruising, burning sensation, depigmentation, dermatitis,<br/>
discoloration, edema, erythema, exfoliation, irritation, papules, petechia, pruritus, vesicles, or<br/>
may be the locus of abnormal sensation. These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving<br/>
spontaneously within a few minutes to hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions</span><br/>
Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are<br/>
characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm,<br/>
pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The<br/>
detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Events</span><br/>
Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality<br/>
has not been established for additional reported adverse events including:<br/>
Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia,<br/>
lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence,<br/>
taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and<br/>
tremor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions</span><br/>
Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of Ambator LidocainePatch are unlikely, due to<br/>
the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of<br/>
lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents,<br/>
including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria,<br/>
confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat,<br/>
cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and<br/>
arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first<br/>
manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may<br/>
include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.<br/>
<span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 7T Pharma at 1-800-941-2848 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">or www.fda.gov/medwatch for voluntary reporting of adverse reactions</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span><br/>
Lidocaine overdose from cutaneous absorption is rare, but could occur. If there is any suspicion of<br/>
lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be<br/>
checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic<br/>
treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine.<br/>
In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity<br/>
should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other<br/>
sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics.<br/>
The oral LD50 of lidocaine HCl is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) in non-fasted female rats<br/>
and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats, which are equivalent to roughly<br/>
4000 mg and 2000 mg, respectively, in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage<br/>
conversion factors between species.</p><p><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span><br/>
Apply Ambator LidocainePatch to intact skin to cover the most painful area. Apply the prescribed<br/>
number of patches (maximum of 3), only once for up to 12 hours within a 24-hour period. Patches may<br/>
be cut into smaller sizes with scissors prior to removal of the release liner. (See HANDLING AND<br/>
DISPOSAL) Clothing may be worn over the area of application. Smaller areas of treatment are<br/>
recommended in a debilitated patient, or a patient with impaired elimination.</p><p>If irritation or a burning sensation occurs during application, remove the patch(es) and do not<br/>
reapply until the irritation subsides.<br/>
When Ambator LidocainePatch is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic<br/>
agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.<br/>
Ambator LidocainePatch may not stick if it gets wet. Avoid contact with water, such as bathing,<br/>
swimming or showering.</p><p><span class="Bold">HANDLING AND DISPOSAL</span><br/>
Hands should be washed after the handling of Ambator LidocainePatch, and eye contact with Ambator<br/>
LidocainePatch should be avoided. Do not store patch outside the sealed envelope. Apply immediately<br/>
after removal from the protective envelope. Fold used patches so that the adhesive side sticks to<br/>
itself and safely discard used patches or pieces of cut patches where children and pets cannot get<br/>
to them. Ambator LidocainePatch should be kept out of the reach of children.</p><p><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED</span><br/>
