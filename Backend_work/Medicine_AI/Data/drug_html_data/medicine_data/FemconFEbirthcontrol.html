This medication also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Femcon FE is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.  Femcon FE is also used to treat moderate acne in women who are at least 15 years old and have started having menstrual periods, and who wish to use birth control pills. There are many available brands of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. Not all brands are listed on this leaflet.</p><p>Femcon FE may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use birth control pills if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.</b></p><p><b>You should not use birth control pills if you have:</b> uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, coronary artery disease, circulation problems (especially with diabetes), undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, severe migraine headaches, if you also take certain hepatitis C medication, if you will have major surgery, if you smoke and are over 35, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, jaundice caused by pregnancy or birth control pills, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p>Taking birth control pills can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not take this medicine if you smoke and are over 35 years old.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Taking birth control pills can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.
