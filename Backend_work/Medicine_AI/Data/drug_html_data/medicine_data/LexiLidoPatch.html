</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LexiLido</span> Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> is a prescription topical patch containing 15 articulated patches (5 per resealable pouch x 3 pouches). Lidocaine is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-(diethylamino)-<span class="Italics">N</span>-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O. The molecular weight of lidocaine is 234.34 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 5% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1<span class="Italics">R</span>,2<span class="Italics">S</span>,5<span class="Italics">R</span>)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for menthol is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol. </p><p>The structural formulas are:</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">**</span> <span class="Bold Underline">Menthol</span> <span class="Bold Underline">**</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Bold Underline">**</span> <span class="Bold Underline">Lidocaine</span><span class="Bold Underline">**</span></p><p></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lidocaine</span> is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Menthol</span> has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LexiLido Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> is a formulation used to assist patients in the treatment of mild to moderate acute or chronic aches or pain. Muscle or joint pain can be due to musculoligamentous strains, simple backache, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, and other complex regional pains. It can also be used to help with certain types of headaches, but use with caution when applying in order to avoid eye contact. If consulted by your physician.</span></p><p>Other uses may be considered if deemed clinically relevant</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to menthol, lidocaine, or any of the topical amide-like anesthetic preparations. .</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excessive dosage, or short interval between doses, can result in high plasma levels and serious adverse effects.
