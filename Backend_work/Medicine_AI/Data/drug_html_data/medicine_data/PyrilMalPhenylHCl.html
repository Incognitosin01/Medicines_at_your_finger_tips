It is also contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or peripheral vascular insufficiency, as ischemia may result, with the risk of gangrene or thrombosis of compromised vascular beds.<br/>

<br/>
Antihistamines may cause excitability, particularly in pediatric patients, but their combination with sympathomimetics may cause either mild stimulation or mild sedation.<br/>

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Bold">Pyril Mal 16 mg/Phenyl HCl 5 mg/5 mL Suspension</span>.

8.2 Labor and Delivery<br/>
Administration of phenylephrine in late pregnancy or labor may cause fetal anoxia or bradycardia by increasing contractility of the uterus and decreasing uterine blood flow.<br/>
<br/>
8.3 Nursing Mothers<br/>
Because of the higher risk of intolerance of antihistamines in small infants generally, and in newborns and prematures in particular, <span class="Bold">Pyril Mal 16 mg/Phenyl HCl 5 mg/5 mL Suspension</span> should not be administered to a nursing mother.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">10.1 Signs and Symptoms<br/>
