</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Sodium fluoride acts systemically and topically by increasing tooth resistance to cavities and acid dissolution, by promoting remineralization.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets 1.0 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg are to be used as a dental caries preventive in children. Ingestion of fluoridated drinking water (1 ppm F-) during the period of tooth development results in a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets were developed to provide systemic fluoride for use as a once daily supplement in children from 6 months to age 3 years and older living in areas where the drinking water fluoride content does not exceed 0.6 ppm F-.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets 1.0 mg are contraindicated when the fluoride content of drinking water is 0.3 ppm F- or more and should not be administered to children under age 6 years. ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets 0.5 mg are contraindicated when the fluoride content of drinking water is more than 0.6 ppm F- and should not be administered to children underage 6 when the fluoride content of drinking water is 0.3 ppm F- or more or to children under age 3 years. ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets 0.25 mg are contraindicated when the fluoride content of drinking water is more than 0.6 ppm F- and should not be administered to children under age 3 years when the fluoride content of drinking water is 0.3 ppm F- or more. Do not administer any strength of ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets to children under age 6 months. ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets are not indicated for use in adults.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Prolonged daily ingestion of quantities greater than the recommended amount may result in various degrees of dental fluorosis in children under age 6 years, especially if the water fluoridation exceeds 0.6 ppm. Read directions carefully before using. Keep out of reach of infants and children.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">:</span></span> Use in children below the age of 6 months is not recommended by current American Dental Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Using fluoride along with dairy foods is not recommended due to formation of calcium fluoride which is poorly absorbed.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> In animals,studies evaluating the carcinogenic potential of fluoride at greater levels than the recommended daily dose of ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets are inconclusive. Fluoride ion is not mutagenic in standard bacterial systems. In vivo data are conflicting. Potential adverse reproductive effects of fluoride exposure in humans has not been adequately evaluated.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. It has been shown that fluoride crosses the placenta of rats, but only 0.01% of the amount administered is incorporated in fetal tissue. Animal studies (rats, mice, rabbits) have shown that fluoride is not a teratogen. Epidemiological studies conducted in areas with high levels of naturally fluoridated water showed no increase in birth defects. Consult your physician before taking this product.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known if fluoride is excreted in human milk. However, many drugs are excreted in human milk and caution should be exercised when ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets are administered to nursing women. Consult your physician before taking this product.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> The use of ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets as a caries preventive in pediatric age groups 6 months to 16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies on fluoride supplementation from birth through adolescence.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> ReNaf Fluoride Chewable Tablets are not indicated for use in geriatric patients.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching) have rarely been reported.

<span class="Bold">Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</span></p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">If you suspect an overdosage contact your physician and/or your local Poison Control Center immediately.</span> Accidental ingestion of large amounts of fluoride may result in acute burning in the mouth and sore tongue.
