DMD is a rare, inherited muscle disease that is caused by absence of a protein called dystrophin, which helps keep muscle cells intact.</p><p>Viltolarsen is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using viltolarsen</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For viltolarsen, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to viltolarsen or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of viltolarsen injection in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of viltolarsen injection in geriatric patients. DMD is usually a disease of children and young adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of viltolarsen. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Kidney diseaseâ€”Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>

It must be given slowly, so the needle should remain in place for at least 60 minutes once a week.</p><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Viltolarsen needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose or forget to use your medicine, call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using viltolarsen</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check your or your child's progress closely while you are receiving viltolarsen</i> to see if it is working properly and to decide if you or your child should continue to receive it.
