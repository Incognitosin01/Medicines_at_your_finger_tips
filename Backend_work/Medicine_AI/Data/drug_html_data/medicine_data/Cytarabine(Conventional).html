Cytarabine gains entry into cells by a carrier process, and then must be converted to its active compound, aracytidine triphosphate. Cytarabine is a pyrimidine analog and is incorporated into DNA; however, the primary action is inhibition of DNA polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair. The degree of cytotoxicity correlates linearly with incorporation into DNA; therefore, incorporation into the DNA is responsible for drug activity and toxicity. Cytarabine is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle (blocks progression from the G<sub>1</sub> to the S phase).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Not effective when administered orally; less than 20% absorbed orally </p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: 3 Â± 11.9 L/kg; total body water; widely and rapidly since it enters the cells readily; crosses blood-brain barrier with CSF levels of 40% to 50% of plasma level</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Primarily hepatic; metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to aracytidine triphosphate (active); about 86% to 96% of dose is metabolized to inactive uracil arabinoside (ARA-U); intrathecal administration results in little conversion to ARA-U due to the low levels of deaminase in the cerebral spinal fluid  </p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (~80%; 90% as metabolite ARA-U) within 24 hours </p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p> IM, SubQ: 20 to 60 minutes</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p> IV: Initial: 7 to 20 minutes; Terminal: 1 to 3 hours; Intrathecal: 2 to 6 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>13%</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia:</b> Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</p><p><b>Acute myeloid leukemia:</b> Remission induction (in combination with other chemotherapy medications) in acute myeloid leukemia in adult and pediatric patients.</p><p><b>Chronic myeloid leukemia:</b> Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase.</p><p><b>Meningeal leukemia:</b> Prophylaxis and treatment of meningeal leukemia.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Acute myeloid leukemia (consolidation)</h3><p>Data from several randomized clinical trials in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) support the use of cytarabine (in combination with daunorubicin or idarubicin or mitoxantrone [5 + 2 regimens], in combination with daunorubicin and etoposide [5 + 2 + 5 regimen], or as a single agent) <sup>[Arlin 1990]</sup>, <sup>[Bishop 1996]</sup>, <sup>[Mayer 1994]</sup>, <sup>[Wiernik 1992]</sup>.</p><h3>Acute myeloid leukemia (salvage)</h3><p>Data from open-label studies in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) support the use of cytarabine (in combination with cladribine and G-CSF [CLAG regimen] <i>or</i> with cladribine, mitoxantrone, and G-CSF [CLAG-M regimen] <i>or</i> in combination with fludarabine and G-CSF [FLAG regimen] <i>or</i> high dose cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline [HiDAC regimen] <i>or</i> in combination with mitoxantrone and etoposide [MEC regimen]) <i>or</i> in combination with clofarabine and filgrastim in the treatment of refractory or relapsed AML in adults <sup>[Amadori 1991]</sup>, <sup>[Archimbaud 1991]</sup>, <sup>[Archimbaud 1995]</sup>, <sup>[Becker 2011]</sup>, <sup>[Herzig 1985]</sup>, <sup>[Montillo 1998]</sup>, <sup>[Wierzbowska 2008]</sup>, <sup>[Wrzesien-Kus 2003]</sup>.</p><h3>Acute promyelocytic leukemia (consolidation)</h3><p>Data from two clinical trials in patients with high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) support the use of cytarabine (in combination with idarubicin and tretinoin) <sup>[Lo Coco 2010]</sup>, <sup>[Sanz 2010]</sup>.

The main toxic effect of cytarabine is bone marrow suppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Less serious toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>The health care provider must judge possible benefit to the patient against known toxic effects of this drug in considering the advisability of therapy with cytarabine. Before making this judgment or beginning treatment, the health care provider should be familiar with the following text.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Bone marrow suppression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Myelosuppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia) is the major toxicity of cytarabine.</b> Use with caution in patients with prior drug-induced bone marrow suppression. Monitor blood counts frequently; once blasts are no longer apparent in the peripheral blood, bone marrow should be monitored frequently. Monitor for signs of infection or neutropenic fever due to neutropenia or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.</p><p>â¢ Cytarabine syndrome: Cytarabine (ARA-C) syndrome is characterized by fever, myalgia, bone pain, chest pain (occasionally), maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, and malaise; generally occurs 6 to 12 hours following administration. May be managed with corticosteroids.</p><p>â¢ GI toxicities: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Toxicities (less serious) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, oral ulcerations and hepatic dysfunction.</b> Antiemetics may be recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting. In adults, IV doses &gt;1,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> are associated with a moderate emetic potential (ASCO [Hesketh 2020]; MASCC/ESMO [Roila 2016]); in pediatrics, a 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV dose is associated with a moderate emetic potential and IV doses â¥3,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> are associated with a high emetic potential (POGO [Paw Cho Sing 2019]).</p><p>â¢ Hepatitis B virus screening: The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.</p><p>â¢ Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis resulting in acute cardiopulmonary arrest has been reported (rare).</p><p>â¢ Pancreatitis: There have been reports of acute pancreatitis in patients receiving continuous infusion cytarabine and in patients receiving cytarabine who were previously treated with L-asparaginase.</p><p>â¢ Sudden respiratory distress syndrome: Sudden respiratory distress, rapidly progressing to pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, has been reported with high-dose cytarabine. May present as severe dyspnea with a rapid onset and refractory hypoxia with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, leading to respiratory failure; may be fatal (Morgan 2011).</p><p>â¢ Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome and subsequent hyperuricemia may occur; consider antihyperuricemic therapy and hydrate accordingly.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; may be at higher risk for CNS toxicities and dosage adjustments may be required.</p><p>â¢ Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function (high dose cytarabine); may be at higher risk for CNS toxicities and dosage adjustments may be required.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Drug-drug interactions: There have been case reports of fatal cardiomyopathy when high-dose cytarabine was used in combination with cyclophosphamide as a preparation regimen for transplantation.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Pediatric: Delayed progressive ascending paralysis has been reported in two children who received combination chemotherapy with IV and intrathecal cytarabine at conventional doses for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (was fatal in one patient).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Benzyl alcohol: Some products may contain benzyl alcohol; do not use products containing benzyl alcohol or products reconstituted with bacteriostatic diluent intrathecally or for high-dose cytarabine regimens. Benzyl alcohol is associated with gasping syndrome in premature infants.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Experienced physician: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced cancer chemotherapy physician. Due to the potential toxicities, induction treatment with cytarabine should be in a facility with sufficient laboratory and supportive resources. </b></p><p>â¢ High-dose treatment: High-dose regimens have been associated with GI, CNS, pulmonary, ocular (reversible corneal toxicity and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; prophylaxis with ophthalmic corticosteroids is recommended) toxicities, and cardiomyopathy. Neurotoxicity associated with high-dose treatment may present as acute cerebellar toxicity (with or without cerebral impairment), personality changes, or may be severe with seizure and/or coma; may be delayed, occurring up to 3 to 8 days after treatment has begun; possibly irreversible. Risk factors for neurotoxicity include cumulative cytarabine dose, prior CNS disease and renal impairment (incidence may be up to 55% in patients with renal impairment); high-dose therapy (&gt;18 g/m<sup>2</sup> per cycle) and age &gt;50 years also increase the risk for cerebellar toxicity (Herzig 1987).</p><p>â¢ Intrathecal safety: When used for intrathecal administration, should not be prepared during the preparation of any other agents. After preparation, store intrathecal medications in an isolated location or container clearly marked with a label identifying as "intrathecal" use only. Delivery of intrathecal medications to the patient should only be with other medications also intended for administration into the central nervous system (Jacobson 2009).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>LFTs, CBC with differential and platelet count, serum creatinine, BUN, serum uric acid. Hepatitis B virus screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning systemic anticancer therapy (ASCO [Hwang 2020]). Monitor for signs/symptoms of bleeding, infection, neutropenic fever, and/or tumor lysis syndrome.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Females of reproductive potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment and be advised of the potential risks if exposure during pregnancy would occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the mechanism of action and findings from animal reproduction studies, fetal harm may occur if cytarabine is administered during pregnancy. Limb and ear defects have been noted in case reports of cytarabine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. The following have also been noted in the neonate: Pancytopenia, WBC depression, electrolyte abnormalities, prematurity, low birth weight, decreased hematocrit or platelets. Risk to the fetus is decreased if treatment can be avoided during the first trimester.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>â¢ It is used to treat leukemia.</p><p>â¢ It may be given to you for other reasons.
