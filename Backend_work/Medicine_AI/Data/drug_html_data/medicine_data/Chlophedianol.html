Chlophedianol should not be used when there is mucus or phlegm (pronounced flem) with the cough.</p><p>Chlophedianol relieves cough by acting on the cough center in the brain.</p><p>Chlophedianol is available without a doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using chlophedianol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For chlophedianol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to chlophedianol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Chlophedianol has been tested in children 2 years of age or older. In effective doses, the medicine has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of chlophedianol in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of chlophedianol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Mucus or phlegm with cough—Since chlophedianol decreases coughing, it makes it difficult to get rid of the mucus that may collect in the lungs and airways with some diseases</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of chlophedianol</h2><p>Do not take liquids immediately after taking chlophedianol. To do so may decrease the soothing effect of the syrup.</p><p>Take chlophedianol only as directed. Do not take more of it and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered or the label directs you to take. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of chlophedianol will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of chlophedianol. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

These signs may mean that you have other medical problems.</p><p>Chlophedianol will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are taking chlophedianol.</p><p>Chlophedianol may also add to the effects of CNS stimulants, such as appetite suppressants and caffeine-containing beverages like tea, coffee, cocoa, and cola drinks. Avoid drinking large amounts of these beverages while taking chlophedianol. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>Chlophedianol may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to chlophedianol before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Chlophedianol side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
