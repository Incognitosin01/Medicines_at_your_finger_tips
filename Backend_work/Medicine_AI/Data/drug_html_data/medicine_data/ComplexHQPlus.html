</ul><p>Rx only</p><p class="First">For External Use Only.</p><h2>Description</h2><p class="First">Complex HQplus contains: Hydroquinone 40 mg/gm.</p><h2>Active Ingredient</h2><p class="First">Hydroquinone, 4%</p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology:</h2><p class="First">Topical application of Hydroquinone produces<br/>
a reversible depigmentation of the skin by inhibition of the enzymatic<br/>
oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and<br/>
suppression of other melanocyte processes. The selective inhibition<br/>
of the enzyme affects melanogenesis in the melanocytes resulting<br/>
in cessation of melanin formation and subsequent reduction in<br/>
pigmentation. Additional studies indicate Hydroquinone acts on<br/>
the essential subcellular metabolic processes of melanocytes with<br/>
resultant cytolysis, i.e. nonenzymediated depigmentation.<br/>
<br/>
Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation<br/>
of the bleached areas, which may be prevented by the use of<br/>
sunblocking agents.</p><h2>Indications &amp; Usage:</h2><p class="First">Complex HQ Plus is indicated for the gradual<br/>
lightening of hyperpigmented skin conditions, such as chloasma,<br/>
melasma, freckles, senile lentigines, and other unwanted areas of<br/>
melanin hyperpigmentation. Sunscreen must be used daily during<br/>
Complex HQ Plus treatment.</p><h2>Contraindications:</h2><p class="First">Prior history of sensitivity or allergic reaction<br/>
to this product or any of its ingredients. The safety of topical<br/>
hydroquinone use during pregnancy or in children (12 years and<br/>
under) has not been established.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">A. Caution: Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may<br/>
produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The<br/>
physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before<br/>
prescribing or dispensing this medication.<br/>
<br/>
B. Test for skin sensitivity before using Hydroquinone Cream by<br/>
applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin and check<br/>
in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where<br/>
there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory<br/>
response, further treatment is not advised. Close patient<br/>
supervision is recommended.<br/>
Contact with the eyes should be avoided. In case of accidental<br/>
contact, patient should rinse eyes thoroughly with water and<br/>
contact physician. A bitter taste and anesthetic effect may occur<br/>
if applied to lips. Keep out of reach of children. If no bleaching<br/>
or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment use,<br/>
Hydroquinone Cream should be discontinued. This product is<br/>
formulated for use as a skin bleaching agent and should not be<br/>
used for the prevention of sunburn.<br/>
<br/>
C. Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of Hydroquinone therapy<br/>
because even minimal sunlight exposure sustains melanocytic<br/>
activity. After clearing and during maintenance therapy, sun<br/>
exposure should be avoided on bleached skin by application of<br/>
a sunscreen or sunblock agent, or protective clothing to prevent<br/>
repigmentation.<br/>
There are no sunblocking or sunscreening agents in Complex<br/>
HQ plus and since minimal sunlight exposure may reverse the<br/>
bleaching effect of this preparation, it should be used only at night<br/>
or on areas of the body covered by protective clothing. During the<br/>
daytime, sunblocking or broad spectrum sunscreen preparations<br/>
or protective clothing should be used to prevent the bleached<br/>
areas from repigmentation.<br/>
<br/>
D. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. In<br/>
case of accidental ingestion, call a physician or a poison control<br/>
center immediately.<br/>
<br/>
E. Warning: Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may<br/>
cause serious allergic type reactions (e.g. hives, itching,<br/>
wheezing, anaphylaxis, severe asthma attacks) in certain<br/>
susceptible persons.</p><h2>Precautions: (see “Warnings”)</h2><p class="First">A. Pregnancy Category C, Animal reproduction studies have not<br/>
been conducted with topical Hydroquinone. It is also not known<br/>
whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when used topically<br/>
on a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. It is not<br/>
known to what degree, if any, topical Hydroquinone is absorbed<br/>
systemically. Topical Hydroquinone should be used in women only<br/>
when clearly indicated.<br/>
<br/>
B. Nursing mothers. It is not known whether topical Hydroquinone<br/>
is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when<br/>
topical Hydroquinone is used by a nursing mother.<br/>
<br/>
C. Pediatric usage. Safety and effectiveness in children below the<br/>
age of 12 years have not been established.</p><h2>Over Dosage:</h2><p class="First">There have been no systemic reactions from the use<br/>
of topical Hydroquinone. However, treatment should be limited to<br/>
relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients<br/>
experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation<br/>
which does not preclude treatment.</p><h2>Drug Dosage and Administration:</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin layer on the skin<br/>
surface in the affected areas twice a day or as directed by<br/>
physician. Use of this product should be discontinued after<br/>
3 months of treatment if no improvement is observed. The lightening<br/>
effect may not be noticeable when used on very dark skin. Sun<br/>
exposure should be avoided. Ti-Silc Sheer SPF 45 or other broad<br/>
spectrum sunblock or protective clothing should be used to prevent<br/>
reoccurring hyperpigmentation.</p><h2>Storage:</h2><p class="First">Complex HQ Plus should be stored at controlled room<br/>
temperature (15-30°C) (59-86°F). Darkening of this product is normal.<br/>
This will not affect performance or safety.</p><h2>Supplied</h2><p class="First">as a 2oz. (56.7 grm) bottle, NDC 62362-012-02</p><h2>Inactive Ingredients:</h2><p class="First">Ascorbic Acid, Butylated Hydroxytoluene,<br/>
