Do not miss any scheduled appointments.</p><p>There are many other medicines that can interact with paclitaxel. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you use. This includes vitamins, minerals, herbal products, and drugs prescribed by other doctors. Do not start using a new medication without telling your doctor.
