</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tri-Lo-Estarylla</h2><h3>Oral Contraception</h3><p class="First">Tri-Lo-Estarylla<span class="Sup">TM</span> (norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets) are indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].</span></p><h2>Tri-Lo-Estarylla Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Start Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM</h3><p class="First">Tri-Lo-Estarylla<span class="Sup">TM</span> is dispensed in a blister pack [see <span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING (16)</span>].

Each blister card contains 28 tablets in the following order:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not prescribe norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol to women who are known to have the following conditions:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impaired Liver Function</span></span></p><p>Do not use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span> Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Liver Tumors</span></span></p><p>Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span> Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)</span>]. Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.</p><p>In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7 to 17% of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></span></p><p>Women who use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><p>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see <span class="Bold">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix</h3><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling:</p><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects)</span></span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%) , fatigue (2.1%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span></span></p><p>In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Serious Adverse Reactions</span></span></p><p>Carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span></span> Urinary tract infection</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps):</span></span> Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders:</span></span> Hypersensitivity</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span></span> Dyslipidemia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span></span> Anxiety, insomnia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span></span> Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders:</span></span> Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Ear and Labyrinth Disorders:</span></span> Vertigo</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders:</span></span> Tachycardia, palpitations</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Vascular Events:</span></span> Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Arterial Events:</span></span> Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span></span> Dyspnea</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span></span> Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary Disorders:</span></span> Hepatitis</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span></span> Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders:</span></span> Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast Disorders:</span></span> Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span></span> Chest pain, asthenic conditions.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.</p><p>No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol.</p><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs</span></span></p><p>Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Colesevelam</span></span></p><p>Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs</span></span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p><h3>Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. [See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2).</span>]</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in women with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdosage of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea.</p><h2>Tri-Lo-Estarylla Description</h2><p class="First">Tri-Lo-Estarylla<span class="Sup">TM</span> (norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, USP) is a combination oral contraceptive containing the progestational compound norgestimate and the estrogenic compound ethinyl estradiol. Norgestimate is designated as (18,19-Dinor-17-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one,17-(acetyloxy)-13-ethyl-, oxime,(17α)-(+)-) and ethinyl estradiol is designated as (19-nor-17α-pregna,1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol).</p><p></p><h2>Tri-Lo-Estarylla - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Norgestimate (NGM) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of NGM. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for NGMN, NG and EE during three cycles of administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol are summarized in <span class="Bold">Table 3.</span></p><p>Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE were generally reached by 2 hours after administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 0.180 mg NGM / 0.025 mg EE dose is approximately 1.5 to 2 fold for NGMN and approximately 1.5 fold for EE compared with single dose administration, in agreement with that predicted based on linear kinetics of NGMN and EE. The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose proportional following NGM doses of 0.180 to 0.250 mg. Steady-state conditions for NGMN following each NGM dose and for EE were achieved during the three cycle study. Non-linear accumulation (4.5–14.5 fold) of NG was observed as a result of high affinity binding to SHBG, which limits its biological activity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3</span> Summary of NGMN, NG and EE pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol During a Three Cycle Study</span></p><p class="First">NGMN(2, 3, 4)</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.91 (0.27)</p><p class="First">1.8 (1)</p><p class="First">5.86 (1.54)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">1.42 (0.43)</p><p class="First">1.8 (0.7)</p><p class="First">11.3 (3.2)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">1.57 (0.39)</p><p class="First">1.8 (0.7)</p><p class="First">13.9 (3.7)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">1.82 (0.54)</p><p class="First">1.5 (0.7)</p><p class="First">16.1 (4.8)</p><p class="First">28.1 (10.6)</p><p class="First">NG(2, 3, 4)</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.32 (0.14)</p><p class="First">2 (1.1)</p><p class="First">2.44 (2.04)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">1.64 (0.89)</p><p class="First">1.9 (0.9)</p><p class="First">27.9 (18.1)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">2.11 (1.13)</p><p class="First">4 (6.3)</p><p class="First">40.7 (24.8)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">2.79 (1.42)</p><p class="First">1.7 (1.2)</p><p class="First">49.9 (27.6)</p><p class="First">36.4 (10.2)</p><p class="First">EE(2, 3, 5)</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">55.6 (18.1)</p><p class="First">1.7 (0.5)</p><p class="First">421 (118)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">91.1 (36.7)</p><p class="First">1.3 (0.3)</p><p class="First">782 (329)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">96.9 (38.5)</p><p class="First">1.3 (0.3)</p><p class="First">796 (273)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">95.9 (38.9)</p><p class="First">1.3 (0.6)</p><p class="First">771 (303)</p><p class="First">17.7 (4.4)</p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>NGMN = Norelgestromin, NG = norgestrel, EE = ethinyl estradiol</p><p><span class="Sup">2</span>C<span class="Sub">max</span> = peak serum concentration, t<span class="Sub">max</span> = time to reach peak serum concentration, AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> = area under serum concentration vs. time curve from 0 to 24 hours, t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> = elimination half-life.</p><p><span class="Sup">3</span>units for all analytes; h = hours</p><p><span class="Sup">4</span>units for NGMN and NG – C<span class="Sub">max</span> = ng/mL, AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> = h•ng/mL</p><p><span class="Sup">5</span>units for EE only – C<span class="Sub">max</span> = pg/mL, AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> = h•pg/mL</p><p>NC = not calculated</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></span></p><p>The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>NGMN and NG are highly bound (&gt;97%) to serum proteins.

NGM's primary active metabolite is NGMN. Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG, which is also active and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, under the recommended dosing regimen, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites, even at the peak serum levels, are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant (Ki).

Increasing body weight and body surface area were each associated with decreases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> values for NGMN and EE and increases in CL/F (oral clearance) for EE. Increasing body weight by 10 kg is predicted to reduce the following parameters: NGMN C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 9% and AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> by 19%, NG C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 12% and AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> by 46%, EE C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 13% and AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> by 12%. These changes were statistically significant. Increasing age was associated with slight decreases (6% with increasing age by 5 years) in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> for NGMN and were statistically significant, but there was no significant effect for NG or EE. Only a small to moderate fraction (5 to 40%) of the overall variability in the pharmacokinetics of NGMN and EE following norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets may be explained by any or all of the above demographic parameters.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">[See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.11)</span> and <span class="Bold">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)</span>.]</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In an active controlled clinical trial lasting 12 months, 1,673 women, 18 to 45 years old completed 11,003 cycles of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol use and a total of 20 pregnancies were reported in norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol users. The racial demographic of those treated with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was: Caucasian (86%), African-American (6%), Asian (2%), and Other (6%). There were no exclusions on the basis of weight; the weight range for women treated was 90 to 240 lbs, with a mean weight of about 142 lbs.
