It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is used long term to improve breathing problems and to reduce the number of COPD flare-ups (worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days). Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.</p><p>Inhaled fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma and COPD symptoms.</p><p>Inhaled umeclidinium and vilanterol are long-acting bronchodilators. These are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs.</p><p>Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Use of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is not recommended in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol</h2><p>Inhaled fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is used to prevent asthma attacks and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>Inhaled fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is used with a special inhaler that comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p><i>Use fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>Use fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol at the same time each day.</p><p>Do not stop using fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol or other breathing medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.</p><p>To use the inhaler:</p><ul>
<li>Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol comes in a foil tray. Peel back the lid to open the tray.</li>
<li>Slide the inhaler cover down until you hear a clicking sound. The inhaler is now ready to use. Do not open the cover of the inhaler until you are ready to use it. Do not close the cover until you have taken the medicine. If you open and close the inhaler without inhaling the dose, you will lose the medicine.</li>
<li>Turn your head away from the inhaler, and breathe out fully. Do not breathe into the inhaler.</li>
<li>Put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not block the air vent with your fingers.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe through your nose.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath for 3 or 4 seconds or for as long as you can before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>When you are finished, you may clean the mouthpiece with a dry tissue, if needed, before closing the inhaler cover.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. When the inhaler has less than 10 doses left, the left half of the counter will show up in red to remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
</ul><p>Rinsing your mouth with water after each dose may help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. Do not swallow the water after rinsing.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol will be different for different patients.
