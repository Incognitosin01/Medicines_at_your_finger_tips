Yaz is a combination birth control pill containing female hormones that prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary). Yaz also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Yaz is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. It is also used to treat moderate acne in women who are at least 14 years old and have started having menstrual periods, and who wish to use birth control pills.</p><p>Yaz is also used to treat the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), such as anxiety, depression, irritability, trouble concentrating, lack of energy, sleep or appetite changes, breast tenderness, joint or muscle pain, headache, and weight gain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Yaz if you are pregnant or if you recently had a baby.</b></p><p><b>Taking Yaz can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> Many medical conditions can increase your risk of blood clot, stroke, or heart attack while taking Yaz. Tell your doctor about any and all medical problems, hospitalizations, surgeries, and medications before taking Yaz. You are even more at risk if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or if you are overweight. Your risk of stroke or blood clot is highest during your first year of taking birth control pills. Your risk is also high when you restart birth control pills after not taking them for 4 weeks or longer. If you are immobile for any reason (after a surgery or during long travel) you may also be at increased risk.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not take Yaz if you smoke and are over 35 years old.</p><p>The different brand names (Beyaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Nikki, Ocella, Rajani, Safyral, Syeda, Vestura, Yasmin, Yaz, Yaela, and Zarah) do not have equal amounts of estrogen in them, but vary from pill to pill. They are not interchangeable. If you are taking Yaz, you should not switch to another brand without speaking to your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Yaz side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Yaz</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Stop using Yaz and call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
