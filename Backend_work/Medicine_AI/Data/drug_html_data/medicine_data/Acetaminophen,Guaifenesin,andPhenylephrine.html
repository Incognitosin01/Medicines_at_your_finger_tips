Specific dose adjustment recommendations are not presently available.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Local Anesthetics: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics. Specifically, the risk for methemoglobinemia may be increased. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Lorlatinib: May decrease the serum concentration of Acetaminophen.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Methotrimeprazine: Products Containing Ethanol may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Methotrimeprazine. Specifically, CNS depressant effects may be increased.  Management: Avoid products containing alcohol in patients treated with methotrimeprazine.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>MetyraPONE: May increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen. More importantly, by inhibiting the conjugative metabolism of acetaminophen, metyrapone may shift the metabolism towards the oxidative route that produces a hepatotoxic metabolite.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Mipomersen: Acetaminophen may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of Mipomersen. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha1-Agonists. While linezolid is expected to interact via this mechanism, management recommendations differ from other monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  Refer to linezolid specific monographs for details.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Nitric Oxide: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents. Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ozanimod: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Concomitant use of ozanimod with sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. If combined, monitor patients closely for the development of hypertension, including hypertensive crises.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Phenylephrine (Systemic): Acetaminophen may increase the serum concentration of Phenylephrine (Systemic). <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Prilocaine: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Prilocaine. Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia.  Management: Monitor patients for signs of methemoglobinemia (e.g., hypoxia, cyanosis) when prilocaine is used in combination with other agents associated with development of methemoglobinemia.  Avoid lidocaine/prilocaine in infants receiving such agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Probenecid: May increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen. Probenecid may also limit the formation of at least one major non-toxic metabolite, possibly increasing the potential for formation of the toxic NAPQI metabolite. Management: Consider limiting acetaminophen use in combination with probenecid. Probenecid may reduce clearance of acetaminophen to one of its non-toxic metabolities, increasing the risk for acetaminophen toxicity, even a lower doses.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Propacetamol: May increase the serum concentration of Phenylephrine (Systemic). Management: Monitor patients closely for increased side effects of phenylephrine if propacetamol is used concomitantly. Patients with underlying blood pressure issues or arrhythmias may need closer monitoring and may warrant consideration of alternative therapies.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sodium Nitrite: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Sodium Nitrite. Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Solriamfetol: Sympathomimetics may enhance the hypertensive effect of Solriamfetol. Sympathomimetics may enhance the tachycardic effect of Solriamfetol. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>SORAfenib: Acetaminophen may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of SORAfenib. SORAfenib may increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen.  Management: Avoid coadministration of acetaminophen and sorafenib if possible. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor for signs/symptoms of hepatotoxicity, particularly in patients with greater acetaminophen exposure.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sympathomimetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tedizolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Tedizolid may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tricyclic Antidepressants: May enhance the therapeutic effect of Alpha1-Agonists. Tricyclic Antidepressants may diminish the therapeutic effect of Alpha1-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Vitamin K Antagonists (eg, warfarin): Acetaminophen may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K Antagonists. This appears most likely with daily acetaminophen doses exceeding 1.3 or 2 g/day for multiple consecutive days. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See individual agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects: </i></b></p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Acetaminophen has been associated with acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death.
