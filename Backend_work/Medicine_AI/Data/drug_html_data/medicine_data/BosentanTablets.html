</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Because of the risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects, Bosentan Tablets is available only through a restricted program called the Bosentan REMS Program. Under the Bosentan REMS, prescribers, patients, and pharmacies must enroll in the program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity<br/></span></span> In clinical studies, Bosentan Tablets caused at least 3-fold upper limit of normal (ULN) elevation of liver aminotransferases (ALT and AST) in about 11% of patients, accompanied by elevated bilirubin in a small number of cases. Because these changes are a marker for potential serious hepatotoxicity, serum aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and then monthly <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. In the postmarketing period, in the setting of close monitoring, rare cases of unexplained hepatic cirrhosis were reported after prolonged (&gt; 12 months) therapy with Bosentan Tablets in patients with multiple comorbidities and drug therapies. There have also been reports of liver failure. The contribution of Bosentan Tablets in these cases could not be excluded.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">In at least one case, the initial presentation (after &gt; 20 months of treatment) included pronounced elevations in aminotransferases and bilirubin levels accompanied by non-specific symptoms, all of which resolved slowly over time after discontinuation of Bosentan Tablets. This case reinforces the importance of strict adherence to the monthly monitoring schedule for the duration of treatment and the treatment algorithm, which includes stopping Bosentan Tablets with a rise of aminotransferases accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elevations in aminotransferases require close attention <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. Bosentan Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with elevated aminotransferases (&gt; 3 x ULN) at baseline because monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be more difficult. If liver aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (such as nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN, treatment with Bosentan Tablets should be stopped. There is no experience with the reintroduction of Bosentan Tablets in these  circumstances.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Bosentan Tablets are likely to cause major birth defects if used by pregnant females based on animal data <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment with Bosentan Tablets. Throughout treatment and for one month after stopping  Bosentan Tablets, females of reproductive potential must use two reliable methods of contraception unless the patient has an intrauterine device (IUD) or tubal sterilization, in which case no other contraception is needed. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable contraceptives should not be used as the sole means of contraception because these may not be effective in patients receiving Bosentan Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>. Obtain monthly pregnancy tests.</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Bosentan Tablets are indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1):</p><p>·         in adults  to improve exercise ability and to decrease clinical worsening. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominantly patients with WHO Functional Class II-IV symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (60%), PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (21%), and PAH associated with congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunts (18%) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Required Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Healthcare professionals who prescribe Bosentan Tablets must enroll in the Bosentan REMS Program and must comply with the required monitoring to minimize the risks associated with Bosentan Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to Bosentan Tablets treatment, monthly during treatment and one month after stopping Bosentan Tablets.

After at least 10 days following the initiation of ritonavir, resume Bosentan Tablets at the recommended initial dose once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability <span class="Italics">[see Cytochrome P450 Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Use in Patients with Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Avoid initiation of Bosentan Tablets in patients with aminotransferases &gt;3 x ULN. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mildly impaired liver function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">62.5 mg tablets: light orange to orange, round, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘419’ on one side and plain on other side. </p><p>125 mg tablets: light orange to orange, oval, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘L420’ on one side and plain on other side. </p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Use of Bosentan Tablets are contraindicated in females who are or may become pregnant. To prevent pregnancy, females of reproductive potential must use two reliable forms of contraception during treatment and for one month after stopping Bosentan Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Use with Cyclosporine A</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of cyclosporine A and bosentan resulted in markedly increased plasma concentrations of bosentan. Therefore, concomitant use of Bosentan Tablets and cyclosporine A is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Cytochrome P450 Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Use with Glyburide</h3><p class="First">An increased risk of liver enzyme elevations was observed in patients receiving glyburide concomitantly with bosentan. Therefore co-administration of glyburide and Bosentan Tablets is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Cytochrome P450 Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Bosentan Tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to bosentan or any component of the product. Observed reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), anaphylaxis, rash, and angioedema <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Description (11)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">ALT or AST &gt; 3 x ULN were observed in 11% of Bosentan Tablets-treated patients (n = 658) compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients (n = 280). Three-fold increases were seen in 12% of 95 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients on 125 mg twice daily and 14% of 70 PAH patients on 250 mg twice daily. Eight-fold increases were seen in 2% of PAH patients on 125 mg twice daily and 7% of PAH patients on 250 mg twice daily. Bilirubin increases to ≥3 x ULN were associated with aminotransferase increases in 2 of 658 (0.3%) of patients treated with Bosentan Tablets.  The combination of hepatocellular injury (increases in aminotransferases of &gt; 3 x ULN) and increases in total bilirubin (≥ 2x ULN) is a marker for potential serious hepatotoxicity.</p><p>Elevations of AST or ALT associated with Bosentan Tablets are dose-dependent, occur both early and late in treatment, usually progress slowly, are typically asymptomatic, and usually have been reversible after treatment interruption or cessation. Aminotransferase elevations also may reverse spontaneously while continuing treatment with Bosentan Tablets.</p><p>Liver aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and then monthly and therapy adjusted accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]</span>. Discontinue Bosentan Tablets if liver aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (such as nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN.</p><p>Avoid initiation of Bosentan Tablets in patients with elevated aminotransferases (&gt; 3 x ULN) prior to drug initiation because monitoring hepatotoxicity in these patients may be more difficult <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>In WHO Functional Class II patients, consider whether the benefits of Bosentan Tablets are sufficient to offset the risk of hepatotoxicity, which may preclude future use as their disease progresses.<br/></p><h3>Embryo-fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Bosentan Tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test prior to Bosentan Tablets treatment, monthly during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use two reliable forms of contraception during treatment with Bosentan Tablets and for at least one month after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><p>Bosentan Tablets are only available for females through a restricted program under REMS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> </p><h3>Prescribing and Distribution Program for Bosentan</h3><p class="First">Because of the risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects, bosentan tablet is available only through a restricted program called the Bosentan REMS Program. As a component of the Bosentan REMS, prescribers, patients, and pharmacies must enroll in the program <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Contraindications (4.1)]</span>.</p><p>Required components of the Bosentan REMS are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Healthcare professionals who prescribe Bosentan Tablets must review the prescriber educational materials, enroll in the Bosentan REMS Program and comply with its requirements.</li>
<li>Healthcare professionals must (1) review serum aminotransferases (ALT/AST) and bilirubin, and agree to order and monitor these tests monthly; and (2) for females of reproductive potential, confirm that the patient is not pregnant, and agree to order and monitor pregnancy tests monthly.</li>
<li>To receive Bosentan Tablets, all patients must understand the risks and benefits, and complete a patient enrollment form.</li>
<li>Pharmacies that dispense Bosentan Tablets must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the Bosentan REMS Program requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Further information about Bosentan REMS Program is available at www.BosentanREMSProgram.com or 1-866-359-2612.</p><h3>Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Peripheral edema is a known clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH and is also a known effect of Bosentan Tablets and other endothelin receptor antagonists. In PAH clinical trials with Bosentan Tablets, combined adverse events of fluid retention or edema were reported in 1.7% (placebo-corrected) of patients.</p><p>In addition, there have been numerous postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension occurring within weeks after starting Bosentan Tablets. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.</p><p>If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as Bosentan Tablets or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for treatment or discontinuation of Bosentan Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease</h3><p class="First">If signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and consider whether Bosentan Tablets should be discontinued.</p><h3>Decreased Sperm Counts</h3><p class="First">Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving Bosentan Tablets. Preclinical data also suggest that Bosentan Tablets, similar to other endothelin receptor antagonists, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit</h3><p class="First">Treatment with Bosentan Tablets can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. There have been postmarketing reports of decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit that have resulted in anemia requiring transfusion. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The  following  important  adverse  reactions  are  described  elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>·         Hepatotoxicity <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions  (5.1)]</span> </p><p>·         Embryo-fetal Toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> </p><p>·         Fluid Retention <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions   (5.4)]</span> </p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Safety data on Bosentan Tablets were obtained from 13 clinical studies (9 placebo-controlled and 4 open-label) in 870 adult patients with PAH and other diseases. Doses up to 8 times the currently recommended clinical dose (125 mg twice daily) were administered for a variety of durations. The exposure to Bosentan Tablets in these trials ranged from 1 day to 4.1 years (n=94 for 1 year; n=61 for 1.5 years; and n=39 for more than 2 years). Exposure of PAH patients (n=328) to Bosentan Tablets ranged from 1 day to 1.7 years (n=174 more than 6 months and n=28 more than 12 months).</p><p>Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events other than those related to pulmonary hypertension during the clinical trials in adult patients with PAH were more frequent on Bosentan Tablets (6%; 15/258 patients) than on placebo (3%; 5/172 patients). In this database the only cause of discontinuations &gt; 1% and occurring more often on Bosentan Tablets was abnormal liver function.</p><p>The adverse drug events that occurred in ≥3% of the Bosentan Tablets-treated patients and were more common on Bosentan Tablets in placebo-controlled trials in PAH at doses of 125 or 250 mg twice daily are shown in Table 3:<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 3: Adverse events<span class="Sup">*</span> occurring in ≥3% of patients treated with Bosentan Tablets 125 to 250  mg  twice daily and more common on Bosentan Tablets in placebo-controlled studies in pulmonary arterial hypertension</span></p><p>* Note: only AEs with onset from start of treatment to 1 calendar day after end of treatment are included. All reported events (at least 3%) are included except those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population.</p><p>** Respiratory Tract Infection combines the terms “Nasopharyngitis”, “Upper Respiratory Tract Infection” and “Respiratory Tract Infection”. </p><p>Combined data from Study 351, BREATHE-1 and EARLY</p><p><span class="Bold">Decreased Sperm Counts</span></p><p>An open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety study evaluated the effect on testicular function of Bosentan Tablets 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, followed by 125 mg twice daily for 5 months. Twenty-five male patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH and normal baseline sperm count were enrolled. Twenty-three completed the study and 2 discontinued due to adverse events not related to testicular function. There was a decline in sperm count of at least 50% in 25% of the patients after 3 or 6 months of treatment with Bosentan Tablets. Sperm count remained within the normal range in all 22 patients with data after 6 months and no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility, or hormone levels were observed. One patient developed marked oligospermia at  3 months and the sperm count remained low with 2 follow-up measurements over the subsequent 6 weeks. Bosentan Tablets were discontinued and after 2 months the sperm count had returned to baseline levels. Based on these findings and preclinical data from endothelin receptor antagonists, it cannot be excluded that endothelin receptor antagonists such as Bosentan Tablets have an adverse effect on  spermatogenesis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit</span></p><p>Treatment with Bosentan Tablets can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment.</p><p>The overall mean decrease in hemoglobin concentration for adult Bosentan Tablets-treated patients was 0.9 g/dL (change to end of treatment). Most of this decrease of hemoglobin concentration was detected during the first few weeks of Bosentan Tablets treatment and hemoglobin levels stabilized by 4 to 12 weeks of Bosentan Tablets treatment. In placebo-controlled studies of all uses of Bosentan Tablets, marked decreases in hemoglobin (&gt; 15% decrease from baseline resulting in values &lt; 11 g/dL) were observed in 6% of Bosentan Tablets-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients. In patients with PAH treated with doses of 125 and 250 mg twice daily, marked decreases in hemoglobin occurred in 3% compared to 1% in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>A decrease in hemoglobin concentration by at least 1 g/dL was observed in 57% of Bosentan Tablets-treated patients as compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients. In 80% of those patients whose hemoglobin decreased by at least 1 g/dL, the decrease occurred during the first 6 weeks of Bosentan Tablets treatment.</p><p>During the course of treatment, the hemoglobin concentration remained within normal limits in 68% of Bosentan Tablets-treated patients compared to 76% of placebo patients. The explanation for the change in hemoglobin is not known, but it does not appear to be hemorrhage or hemolysis.<br/></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">There have been several postmarketing reports of angioedema associated with the use of Bosentan Tablets. The onset of the reported cases occurred within a range of 8 hours to 21 days after starting therapy. Some patients were treated with an antihistamine and their signs of angioedema resolved without discontinuing Bosentan Tablets.</p><p>The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during the postapproval use of Bosentan Tablets. Because these adverse reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Bosentan Tablets exposure:</p><p>Unexplained hepatic cirrhosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span></p><p>Liver failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span></p><p>Hypersensitivity, DRESS, and anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.4)]</span></p><p>Thrombocytopenia</p><p>Rash</p><p>Jaundice</p><p>Anemia requiring transfusion</p><p>Neutropenia and leukopenia</p><p>Nasal congestion</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Cytochrome P450 Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Bosentan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A. Inhibition of these enzymes may increase the plasma concentration of bosentan <span class="Italics">[see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]</span>. Concomitant administration of both a CYP2C9 inhibitor (such as fluconazole or amiodarone) and a strong CYP3A inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) or a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (e.g., amprenavir, erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem) with Bosentan Tablets will likely lead to large increases in plasma concentrations of bosentan. Co-administration of such combinations of a CYP2C9 inhibitor plus a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor with Bosentan Tablets are not recommended. </p><p>Bosentan is an inducer of CYP3A and CYP2C9. Consequently plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these two isozymes will be decreased when Bosentan Tablets are co-administered. Bosentan had no relevant inhibitory effect on any CYP isozyme in vitro (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A). Consequently, Bosentan Tablets are not expected to increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. </p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1.

<br/>
</span></p><h3>Hormonal Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms, may not be reliable when Bosentan Tablets are co-administered. Females should practice additional methods of contraception and not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking Bosentan Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><p>An interaction study demonstrated that co-administration of bosentan and a combination oral hormonal contraceptive produced average decreases of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol levels of 14% and 31%, respectively. However, decreases in exposure were as much as 56% and 66%, respectively, in individual subjects.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk  Summary</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Bosentan Tablets may cause fetal harm, including birth defects and fetal death, when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</span>. There are limited data on Bosentan Tablets use in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of bosentan to pregnant rats at 2-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis caused teratogenic effects in rats, including malformations of the head, mouth, face, and large blood vessels <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data].</span> Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span> </p><p>Bosentan was teratogenic in rats given oral doses two times the MRHD (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). In an embryo-fetal toxicity study in rats, bosentan showed dose-dependent teratogenic effects, including malformations of the head, mouth, face and large blood vessels. Bosentan increased stillbirths and pup mortality at oral doses 2 and 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). Although birth defects were not observed in rabbits given oral doses of up to the equivalent of 10.5 g/day in a 70 kg person, plasma concentrations of bosentan in rabbits were lower than those reached in the rat. The similarity of malformations induced by bosentan and those observed in endothelin-1 knockout mice and in animals treated with other endothelin receptor antagonists indicates that embryo-fetal toxicity is a class effect of these drugs<span class="Italics">.</span> </p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk  Summary</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of bosentan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, such as fluid retention and hepatotoxicity, in breastfed infants from Bosentan Tablets, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Bosentan Tablets.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span> </p><p>Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Bosentan Tablets, monthly during treatment and one month after stopping treatment with Bosentan Tablets. The patient should contact her physician immediately for pregnancy testing if onset of menses is delayed or pregnancy is suspected. If the pregnancy test is positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risks to her, the pregnancy, and the fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span> </p><p>Drug interaction studies show that bosentan reduces serum levels of the estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives. Based on these findings, hormonal contraceptives (including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable contraceptives) may be less effective for preventing pregnancy in patients using Bosentan Tablets and should not be used as a patient’s only contraceptive method <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span> Females of reproductive potential using Bosentan Tablets must use two acceptable methods of contraception during treatment and for 1 month after treatment with Bosentan Tablets. Patients may choose one highly effective form of contraception (intrauterine devices (IUD) or tubal sterilization) or a combination of methods (hormone method with a barrier method or two barrier methods). If a partner’s vasectomy is the chosen method of contraception, a hormone or barrier method must be used along with this method. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention, including emergency contraception, or designate counseling by another healthcare provider trained in contraceptive counseling <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span> </p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Males</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span> </p><p>Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving Bosentan Tablets. Based on these findings and findings in animals, Bosentan Tablets may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether effects on fertility would be reversible <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span> </p><p>In a juvenile rat toxicity study, rats were treated from Day 4 postpartum to adulthood (Day 69 postpartum). Decreased body weights, absolute weights of testes and epididymides, and reduced number of sperm in epididymides were observed after weaning. No effect on testis histology or sperm morphology and function was seen. The NOAEL was 4 times (at Day 4 postpartum) and 2 times (Day 69 postpartum) the human therapeutic exposure, respectively.</p><p>No effects on general development, sensory, cognitive function and reproductive performance were detected at the highest dose tested in juvenile rats, 7 times the therapeutic exposure in children with PAH. </p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Bosentan Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Because there is <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> evidence that the main route of excretion of bosentan is biliary, liver impairment could be expected to increase exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) of bosentan. The pharmacokinetics of Bosentan Tablets have not been evaluated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the systemic exposures to bosentan and its active metabolite increased significantly. Bosentan Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment. Pharmacokinetics of bosentan were not altered in patients with mild impairment of hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class A) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bosentan is small and does not require dosing adjustment <span class="Italics">[see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Bosentan has been given as a single dose of up to 2400 mg in normal volunteers, or up to 2000 mg/day for 2 months in patients, without any major clinical consequences. The most common side effect was headache of mild to moderate intensity. In the cyclosporine A interaction study, in which doses of 500 and 1000 mg twice daily of bosentan were given concomitantly with cyclosporine A, trough plasma concentrations of bosentan increased 30-fold, resulting in severe headache, nausea, and vomiting, but no serious adverse events. Mild decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate were observed.</p><p>In the postmarketing period, there was one reported overdose of 10,000 mg of Bosentan Tablets taken by an adolescent male patient. He had symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dizziness, sweating, and blurred vision. He recovered within 24 hours with blood pressure support.</p><p>Bosentan is unlikely to be effectively removed by dialysis due to the high molecular weight and extensive plasma protein binding. </p><h2>Bosentan Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist that belongs to a class of highly substituted pyrimidine derivatives, with no chiral centers. It is designated chemically as 4-tert-butyl-N-[6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-[2,2´]-bipyrimidin-4-yl]-benzenesulfonamide monohydrate and has the following structural formula:<br/>
</p><p>Bosentan has a molecular weight of 569.62 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">29</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>S•H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. Bosentan is a white to yellowish powder. It is soluble in dichloromethane (98.14 mg/mL), freely soluble in acetone (125.1 mg/mL), slightly soluble in methanol (1.44 mg/mL) and practically insoluble in water (&lt;0.10 mg/mL). In the pH range of 1.1 to 7.5 it is practically insoluble. In the solid state, bosentan is very stable, is not hygroscopic and is not light sensitive.</p><p>Bosentan tablet is available as 62.5 mg and 125 mg film-coated tablets for oral administration, and contains the following excipients: corn starch, pregelatinized starch, povidone K-30, sodium starch glycolate, glyceryl behenate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, talc, ethylcellulose, iron oxide yellow, and iron oxide red. Each Bosentan Tablets 62.5 mg tablet contains 64.541 mg of bosentan, equivalent to 62.5 mg of anhydrous bosentan. Each Bosentan Tablets 125 mg tablet contains 129.082 mg of bosentan, equivalent to 125 mg of anhydrous bosentan.</p><h2>Bosentan Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ET<span class="Sub">A</span> and ET<span class="Sub">B</span>. Bosentan has a slightly higher affinity for ET<span class="Sub">A</span> receptors than for ET<span class="Sub">B</span> receptors. The clinical impact of dual endothelin blockage is unknown.</p><p>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ET<span class="Sub">A</span> and ET<span class="Sub">B</span> receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with PAH, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease.  </p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span> </p><p>After oral administration, maximum plasma concentrations of bosentan are attained within 3 to 5 hours and the terminal elimination half-life is about 5 hours in healthy adult subjects. The exposure to bosentan after intravenous and oral administration is about twice as high in adult patients with PAH as it is in healthy adult subjects.  </p><p> <span class="Bold">Absorption</span> </p><p>The absolute bioavailability of bosentan in normal volunteers is about 50% and is unaffected by food.</p><p> Bosentan is highly bound (&gt; 98%) to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Bosentan does not penetrate into erythrocytes. The volume of distribution is about 18 L.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Elimination</span> </p><p> <span class="Italics">Metabolism</span> </p><p>Bosentan has three metabolites, one of which is pharmacologically active and may contribute 10% to 20% of the effect of bosentan. Bosentan is an inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A and possibly also of CYP2C19. Upon multiple oral dosing, plasma concentrations in healthy adults decrease gradually to 50% to 65% of those seen after single dose administration, probably the effect of auto-induction of the metabolizing liver enzymes. Steady-state is reached within 3 to 5 days.</p><p> <span class="Italics">Excretion</span> </p><p>Bosentan is eliminated by biliary excretion following metabolism in the liver. Less than 3% of an administered oral dose is recovered in urine. Total clearance after a single intravenous dose is about 4 L/h in patients with PAH.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span> <br/>
<span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span> </p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> evidence showing extensive hepatic metabolism of bosentan suggests that liver impairment could significantly increase exposure to bosentan. In a study comparing 8 patients with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) to 8 controls, the single-and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of bosentan were not altered in patients with mild hepatic impairment.</p><p> In another small (N=8) pharmacokinetic study, the steady-state AUC of bosentan was on average 4.7 times higher and the active metabolite Ro 48-5033 was 12.4 times higher in 5 patients with moderately impaired liver function (Child-Pugh Class B) and PAH associated with portal hypertension than in 3 patients with normal liver function and PAH of other etiologies.</p><p> The pharmacokinetics of Bosentan Tablets have not been evaluated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. </span> </p><p> <span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span> </p><p>In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to 30 mL/min), plasma concentrations of bosentan were essentially unchanged and plasma concentrations of the three metabolites were increased about 2-fold compared to subjects with normal renal function. These differences do not appear to be clinically important<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p> <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions </span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Ketoconazole</span> </p><p>Co-administration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 100% in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of Bosentan Tablets is necessary, but increased effects of Bosentan Tablets should be considered.</p><p> <span class="Italics">Warfarin</span> </p><p>Co-administration of bosentan 500 mg twice daily for 6 days in normal volunteers decreased the plasma concentrations of both S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) and R-warfarin (a CYP3A substrate) by 29 and 38%, respectively. Clinical experience with concomitant administration of Bosentan Tablets and warfarin in patients with PAH did not show clinically relevant changes in INR or warfarin dose (baseline vs. end of the clinical studies), and the need to change the warfarin dose during the trials due to changes in INR or due to adverse events was similar among Bosentan Tablets-and placebo-treated patients.</p><p> <span class="Italics">Digoxin, Nimodipine, and Losartan</span> </p><p>Bosentan has no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with digoxin and nimodipine, and losartan has no significant effect on plasma levels of bosentan.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Sildenafil</span> </p><p>In normal volunteers, co-administration of multiple doses of 125 mg twice daily bosentan and 80 mg three times daily sildenafil resulted in a reduction of sildenafil plasma concentrations by 63% and increased bosentan plasma concentrations by 50%. The changes in plasma concentrations were not considered clinically relevant and dose adjustments are not necessary. This recommendation holds true when sildenafil is used for the treatment of PAH or erectile dysfunction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Tadalafil</span><br/>
Bosentan (125 mg twice daily) reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure (AUC) by 42% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 27% following multiple dose co-administration. Tadalafil did not affect the exposure (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of bosentan or its metabolites.<br/>

In the same study, doses greater than 2000 mg/kg/day (about 32 times the MRHD) were associated with an increased incidence of colon adenomas in both males and females. In rats, dietary administration of bosentan for two years was associated with an increased incidence of brain astrocytomas in males at doses as low as 500 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the MRHD). In a comprehensive battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests (the microbial mutagenesis assay, the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, and human lymphocyte assay) and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay, there was no evidence for any mutagenic or clastogenic activity of bosentan. </p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility/Testicular Function</span></p><p>The development of testicular tubular atrophy and impaired fertility has been linked with the chronic administration of certain endothelin receptor antagonists in rodents.</p><p>Treatment with bosentan at oral doses of up to 1500 mg/kg/day (50 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) or intravenous doses up to 40 mg/kg/day had no effects on sperm count, sperm motility, mating performance or fertility in male and female rats. An increased incidence of testicular tubular atrophy was observed in rats given bosentan orally at doses as low as 125 mg/kg/ day (about 4 times the MRHD and the lowest doses tested) for two years but not at doses as high as 1500 mg/kg/day (about 50 times the MRHD) for 6 months. Effects on sperm count and motility were evaluated only in the much shorter duration fertility studies in which males had been exposed to the drug for 4 to 6 weeks. An increased incidence of tubular atrophy was not observed in mice treated for 2 years at doses up to 4500 mg/kg/day (about 75 times the MRHD) or in dogs treated up to 12 months at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 50 times the MRHD).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WHO Functional Class III-IV</span></p><p>Two randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 32 and 213 patients. The larger study (BREATHE-1) compared 2 doses (125 mg twice daily and 250 mg twice daily) of Bosentan Tablets with placebo. The smaller study (Study 351) compared 125 mg twice daily with placebo. Patients had severe (WHO functional Class III–IV) PAH: idiopathic or heritable PAH (72%) or PAH associated with scleroderma or other connective tissue diseases (21%), or to autoimmune diseases (7%). There were no patients with PAH associated with other conditions such as HIV disease or recurrent pulmonary emboli.</p><p>In both studies, Bosentan Tablets or placebo was added to patients’ current therapy, which could have included a combination of digoxin, anticoagulants, diuretics, and vasodilators (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors), but not epoprostenol. Bosentan Tablets was given at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then at 125 mg twice daily or 250 mg twice daily for either 12 (BREATHE-1) or 8 (Study 351) additional weeks. The primary study endpoint was 6-minute walk distance. In addition, symptoms and functional status were assessed. Hemodynamic measurements were made at 12 weeks in Study 351.</p><p>The mean age was about 49 years. About 80% of patients were female, and about 80% were Caucasian.

Walking distance was somewhat greater with 250 mg twice daily, but the potential for increased hepatotoxicity causes this dose not to be recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. There were no apparent differences in treatment effects on walk distance among subgroups analyzed by demographic factors, baseline disease severity, or disease etiology, but the studies had little power to detect such differences.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 5.

In a pair of studies, 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35%, on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and other therapies, were randomized to placebo or Bosentan Tablets (62.5 mg twice daily titrated as tolerated to 125 mg twice daily) and followed for up to 70 weeks. Use of Bosentan Tablets was associated with no benefit on patient global assessment (the primary end point) or mortality. However, hospitalizations for heart failure were more common during the first 4 to 8 weeks after Bosentan Tablets were initiated. In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe chronic heart failure, there was an increased incidence of hospitalization for CHF associated with weight gain and increased leg edema during the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with Bosentan Tablets. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure. </p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">62.5 mg, light orange to orange, round, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘419’ on one side and plain on other side. </p><p>NDC 46708-383-60                Bottle of 60 tablets</p><p>NDC 46708-383-10                Carton of 30 (3 x 10) unit dose tablets.
