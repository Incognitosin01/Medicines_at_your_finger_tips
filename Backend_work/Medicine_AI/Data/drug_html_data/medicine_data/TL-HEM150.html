It is a useful adjuvant in patients in whom erythropoiesis is suppressed due to severe infections, malignancies or to the toxic effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents. A deficiency of Vitamin E may increase the fragility of red blood cells, with resultants enhanced hemolysis.</p><p>TL-HEM 150 is a hematinic preparation containing multiple ingredients essential to normal erythropoiesis, plus a stool softener to counteract the possible constipating effects of iron. Vitamin C is present to aid the absorption of iron.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dose.</p><p>Some patients affected with pernicious anemia may not respond to orally administered Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> with intrinsic factor concentrate and there is no known way to predict which patients will respond or which patients may cease to respond. Periodic examinations, laboratory studies of pernicious anemia patients are essential and recommended. If any symptoms of intolerance occur, the drug should be temporarily or permanently discontinued, which should be determined by a physician.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with this product have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Sufficient clinical studies on this product have not been performed in sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac functions, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions with iron therapy may include gastrointestinal intolerance, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dark stools and abdominal pain. Skin rashes of various types may occur. Such reactions may necessitate temporary or permanent changes in dosage or usage. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>TL-HEM 150 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One caplet daily or as prescribed by a physician.</p><h2>How is TL-HEM 150 Supplied</h2><p class="First">TL-HEM 150 is supplied in bottles of 90 caplets.</p><p>NDC 13811-606-90</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at Controlled Room Temperature 15°-30° C (59°- 86°F).
