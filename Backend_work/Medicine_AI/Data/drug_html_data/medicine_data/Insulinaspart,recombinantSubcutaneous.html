Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health. Since insulin aspart acts faster than regular human insulin, you normally should use insulin aspart with a longer-acting insulin.</p><p>Insulin aspart, recombinant is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using insulin aspart, recombinant</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For insulin aspart, recombinant, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to insulin aspart, recombinant or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Fiasp®</i> in children. However, safety and efficacy of insulin aspart <i>mix 50/50</i> and <i>mix 70/30</i> in the pediatric population have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of insulin aspart have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of insulin aspart in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart, liver, or kidney problems which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving insulin aspart.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking insulin aspart, recombinant, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using insulin aspart, recombinant with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of insulin aspart, recombinant</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional may give you insulin aspart, recombinant. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. Insulin aspart, recombinant is given as a shot under your skin or into a vein.</p><p>Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin <i>and</i> your dose. <i>Concentration and dose are not the same.</i> The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.</p><p>Each package of insulin aspart contains a patient information sheet. Read this sheet carefully before beginning treatment and each time you refill for any new information, and make sure you understand:</p><ul>
<li>How to prepare the medicine.</li>
<li>How to inject the medicine.</li>
<li>How to use disposable insulin delivery device.</li>
<li>How to use external insulin pump.</li>
<li>How and when to change the infusion set, cartridge adapter, and insulin in the external insulin pump reservoir.</li>
<li>How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.</li>
</ul><p>It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your abdomen or stomach, thigh, buttocks, or upper arm). If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.</p><p>Insulin aspart, recombinant should appear clear and colorless. Do not use it if it is discolored, cloudy or thick, or has particles in it.</p><p>When used as a mealtime insulin, <i>Novolog®</i> should be taken within 5 to 10 minutes before a meal or immediately before a meal. Take <i>Fiasp®</i> at the start of a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal.</p><p>When used in an <i>insulin pump</i>: Carefully read and follow the external insulin pump instructions. This insulin should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted when used in an insulin pump. The insulin aspart in the pump should be changed at least every 6 days and the infusion set and insertion site changed at least every 3 days. If you do not understand how you are to use the insulin pump, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p>Use a new needle for the <i>cartridge</i> or <i>pen</i> each time you give yourself an injection. Always remove and throw the needle after each injection from the pen, and store without a needle attached.</p><p>When injecting the <i>Fiasp® FlexTouch® pen</i>, slowly count to 6 before removing it from the skin to get your full dose of the medicine.</p><p><i>Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you</i>. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.</p><p>You should never mix insulin aspart with other insulin injections without checking with your doctor first. These injections are usually done separately. If you have questions about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p>Do not change the brand, type, or dose of your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. When you receive a new supply of insulin, check the label to be sure if it is the correct type of insulin.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of insulin aspart, recombinant will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of insulin aspart, recombinant. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
