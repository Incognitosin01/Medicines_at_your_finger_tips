Low levels of dopamine in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Apokyn is a prescription medicine used to treat "wearing-off" episodes (muscle stiffness, loss of muscle control) in people with advanced Parkinson's disease.</p><p>It is not known if Apokyn is safe and effective in children.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Serious drug interactions can occur when certain medicines are used together with Apokyn. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all medicines you use now, and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><p>You should not use Apokyn if you also taking alosetron (Lotronex), dolasetron (Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril), ondansetron (Zofran), or palonosetron (Aloxi).</p><p>Before using Apokyn, tell your doctor if you have an electrolyte imbalance (such as low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood), a slow heart rate, low blood pressure or dizzy spells, a history of "Long QT syndrome," a history of stroke or heart attack, asthma, sulfite allergy, or liver or kidney disease.</p><p>You may have increased sexual urges, unusual urges to gamble, or other intense urges while taking this medication. Talk with your doctor if you believe you have any intense or unusual urges while taking Apokyn.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Apokyn if you are allergic to apomorphine.</p><p>Many drugs can interact and cause dangerous effects.

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.</p><p>Apokyn injection is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p><b>Do not inject Apokyn into a vein.</b></p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Measuring your Apokyn injection dose correctly is extremely important. The dose in an apomorphine injection pen is measured in milliliters (mL) marked on the pen. However, your prescribed dose may be in milligrams (mg). One milligram, or 1 mg, of apomorphine is equal to 0.1 mL marked on the injection pen.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will show you where on your body to inject Apokyn. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>You may be given other medications to help prevent nausea and vomiting. <b>Use only the anti-nausea medicine prescribed by your doctor</b>. Some anti-nausea medicines can increase certain side effects of apomorphine, or can make your Parkinson's symptoms worse.</p><p>Your blood pressure will need to be checked often.</p><p><b>The medicine in an Apokyn injection pen can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or on your skin.</b> If this happens, rinse with water.</p><p>Do not stop using Apokyn suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms such as fever and confusion. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>If you stop using Apokyn injection for 7 days or longer, ask your doctor before restarting the medication. You may need to restart with a lower dose.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Apokyn for Parkinson's Disease:</b></p><p>Dose initiation should be supervised by a healthcare provider: Antiemetic premedication should be initiated prior to therapy due to high incidence of nausea and vomiting<br/>
