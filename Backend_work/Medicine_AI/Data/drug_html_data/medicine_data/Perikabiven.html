Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> may be used to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency or treat negative nitrogen balance in adult patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><p>Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years, including preterm infants because the fixed content of the formulation does not meet the nutritional requirements of this age group <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span></span> .</p><h2>Perikabiven Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Administration</h3><ul>
<li>Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is for intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. </span></span></li>
<li>Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter.</li>
<li>Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism.</li>
<li>Use a dedicated line without any connections.  Multiple connections could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. </li>
<li>Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing intravenous solutions such as Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> via a Y-site due to precipitation.  However, ceftriaxone and Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span></span> .</li>
<li>Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP).  Administration sets that contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components have DEHP as a plasticizer.</li>

<br/>
</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Dosing Considerations</h3><p class="First">The dosage of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition (ability to adequately metabolize amino acids, dextrose and lipids), body weight and nutritional/fluid requirements, as well as additional energy given orally/enterally to the patient.</p><p>Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is a combination of amino acids, electrolytes, dextrose, and lipids in a fixed volume and concentration.  The dosage selection is based upon fluid requirements which can be used in conjunction with the nutritional requirements to determine final dosage [see Table 1]. <span class="Bold"> </span> Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> meets the total nutritional requirements for protein, dextrose and lipids in stable patients, and can be individualized to meet specific needs with the addition of nutrients.  The maximum infusion rate is based upon the dextrose component.</p><p>Prior to administration of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span>, correct severe fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders.  Before starting the infusion, obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value. </p><p><span class="Bold">Recommended Adult Dosage</span></p><p>The recommended dosage of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> in adults is 27 to 40 mL/kg/day. The recommended daily nutritional requirements for protein, dextrose and lipids compared to the amount of nutrition provided by Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> are shown in Table 1.  </p><p>The maximum daily dosage of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> in adults should not exceed 40 mL/kg/day.</p><p>In patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg/dL, stop the Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels.  Once the triglycerides are &lt;400 mg/dL, restart Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> at a lower infusion rate and advance rate in smaller increments towards target dosage, checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4) and  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold"> <br/>

When infused intravenously amino acids are metabolized and utilized as the building blocks of protein.</p><p>Treatment with Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> may be continued for as long as is required by the patient’s condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosing in Renal Impairment</span></p><p>In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> should be the recommended adult dosage (see above). Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> administered as required <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span> .</p><p>Renal patients not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses <span class="Sup">2</span>. The Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> dosage can be adjusted based on the treatment for the renal impairment, supplementing protein as indicated. Additional protein may be added to Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> bag or infused separately. If required, additional amino acids may be added to the Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> bag or infused separately.  Compatibility of additions should be evaluated by a pharmacist and questions may be directed to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infusion Duration and Rate</span></p><p>The recommended duration of infusion for Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation.</p><p>The maximum infusion rate of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is 3.7 mL/kg/hour.  This corresponds to 0.09 g/kg/hour of amino acids, 0.25 g/kg/hour of dextrose (the rate limiting factor) and 0.13 g/kg/hour of lipid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosing Instructions</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile, hypertonic emulsion in a three chamber container.  The individual chambers contain one of the following respectively: amino acids and electrolytes, dextrose, or lipid injectable emulsion. Table 2 describes the individual components of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Contents of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> when mixed</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The use of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is contraindicated in patients with the following:</p><ul>
<li>Known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean proteins, peanut proteins, corn or corn products or to any of the active substances or excipients</li>
<li>Severe hyperlipidemia or severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride concentration &gt;1,000 g/dL) <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span></span></li>
<li>Inborn error of amino acid metabolism</li>
<li>Cardiopulmonary instability (including pulmonary edema, cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, acidosis and hemodynamic instability requiring significant vasopressor support)</li>
<li>Hemophagocytic syndrome</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Death in Preterm Infants</h3><p class="First">Deaths in preterm infants after infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported. Autopsy findings included intravascular lipid accumulation in the lungs.</p><p>Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion.</p><p>The safe and effective use of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> injection in pediatric patients, including preterm infants, has not been established.   Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years including preterm infants.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Stop infusion immediately and treat patient accordingly if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or allergic reaction develop. Signs or symptoms may include: tachypnea, dyspnea, hypoxia, bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypotension, cyanosis, vomiting, nausea, headache, sweating, dizziness, altered mentation, flushing, rash, urticaria, erythema, pyrexia and chills.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients who require parenteral nutrition are at high risk of infections due to malnutrition and their underlying disease state. Infection and sepsis may occur as a result of the use of intravenous catheters to administer parenteral nutrition, poor maintenance of catheters, or immunosuppressive effects of illness, drugs, and parenteral formulations.</p><p>Decrease the risk of septic complications with heightened emphasis on aseptic technique in catheter placement and maintenance, as well as aseptic technique in the preparation of the nutritional formula.</p><p>Monitor for signs and symptoms (including fever and chills) of early infections, including laboratory test results (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia) and frequent checks of the parenteral access device. </p><h3>Fat Overload Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations. A  reduced or limited ability to metabolize the lipid contained in Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> accompanied by  prolonged plasma clearance may result in a syndrome characterized by a sudden deterioration in the  patient's condition accompanied by fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders,  hyperlipidemia, liver fatty infiltration (hepatomegaly), deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations (e.g., coma). The cause of the fat overload syndrome is unclear. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion of the lipid emulsion is stopped. Although it has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dosage was exceeded, cases have also been described where the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions.</p><h3>Refeeding Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Refeeding severely undernourished patients with parenteral nutrition may result in the refeeding syndrome, characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. Carefully monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intakes, while avoiding overfeeding, to prevent these complications.</p><h3>Diabetes/Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. With the administration of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span>, hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar syndrome may result.   Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma and death.  Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimum levels while infusing Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span>.  Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> administration.</p><h3>Monitoring/Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Routine Monitoring</span></p><ul>
<li>Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory determinations are necessary for proper monitoring during administration.</li>
<li>Monitor fluid status closely in patients with heart failure or pulmonary edema.</li>
<li>Monitor serum triglycerides, fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, and blood count, including platelet and coagulation parameters, throughout treatment. In situations of severely elevated electrolyte levels stop Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> until levels have been corrected.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Essential Fatty Acids</span></p><p>Monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) is recommended. Laboratory tests are available to determine serum fatty acids levels. Reference values should be consulted to help determine adequacy of essential fatty acid status. Increasing essential fatty acid intake (enterally or parenterally) is effective in treating and preventing EFAD.</p><p>In Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span>, the mean composition of linoleic acid (an omega-6 essential fatty acid) is 19 mg/mL (range 17 to 20 mg/mL) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 essential fatty acid) is 2.3 mg/mL (range 1.8 to 3.8 mg/mL).  There are insufficient long-term data to determine whether Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> can supply essential fatty acids in adequate amounts in patients who may have increased requirements.</p><h3>Thrombophlebitis</h3><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for peripheral administration, or may be infused into a central vein. Peripheral catheters should not be used for solutions with osmolarity of ≥ 900 mOsm/L. The primary complication of peripheral access is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain, erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. The catheter should be removed as soon as thrombophlebitis develops.</p><h3>Precipitation with Ceftriaxone</h3><p class="First">Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> in the same intravenous administration line.   Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> via a Y-site. However, ceftriaxone and Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[</span></span>s <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">ee Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span></span> .</p><h3>Hepatobiliary Disorders</h3><p class="First">Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients without preexisting liver disease who receive parenteral nutrition, including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic failure. The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients.</p><p>Increase of blood ammonia levels and hyperammonemia may occur in patients receiving amino acid solutions. In some patients this may indicate hepatic insufficiency or the presence of an inborn error of amino acid metabolism <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span></span> or hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia.  Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify causative and contributory factors, and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.</p><h3>Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with renal impairment, such as pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction and protein-losing nephropathy may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance. Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> dosage may require adjustment with specific attention to fluid, protein and electrolyte content in these patients.</p><p>Monitor renal function parameters.  Patients developing signs of renal impairment should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in renal disease in order to determine the appropriate Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> dosage and other treatment options.</p><h3>Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">To evaluate the patient’s capacity to eliminate and metabolize the infused lipid emulsion, measure serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value), with each increase in dosage, and regularly throughout treatment.</p><p>Reduce dose of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> and monitor serum triglyceride levels in patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg/dL to avoid the clinical consequences associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Serum triglyceride levels above 1,000 mg/dL have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis.</p><p>Impaired lipid metabolism with hypertriglyceridemia may occur in conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. In these cases, increased triglycerides can also be increased by dextrose and/or overfeeding. Monitor overall energy intake and other sources of lipid and dextrose, as well as drugs that may interfere with lipid and dextrose metabolism.</p><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum.</p><p>The aluminum contained in Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with impaired kidney function.   Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products.         </p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">High levels of lipids in plasma may interfere with some laboratory blood tests such as hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin, LDH, and oxygen saturation, if blood is sampled before lipid has been cleared from the bloodstream. Lipids are normally cleared after a lipid-free interval of 5 to 6 hours in most patients.</p><p>Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> contains Vitamin K <span class="Sub">1</span> which may interfere with anticoagulant activity <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span></span> .</p><h3>Risk of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) has been reported in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants, and can present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis. The exact etiology is unknown and is likely multifactorial. Intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid formulations have been associated with development of PNALD although a causal relationship has not been established. If Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> treated patients develop liver test abnormalities consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. </p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The clinical data described for Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> reflects exposure in 93 patients exposed for 5 to 7 days in 4 active-controlled trials. The pooled population exposed to Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> was 18 to 87 years old, 48% female, 73% Caucasian. The enrolled patients had varied underlying conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders (55%), vascular disorders (30%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (28%), respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (22%), and psychiatric disorders (20%). Most patients received peripheral intravenous infusion doses of ≥80% of their target mean daily exposure.</p><p>Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients who received Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> are shown in Table 3.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3:  Adverse Reactions in &gt;2% of Patients Treated with Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span></span></p><p>* Terms as reported in clinical studies</p><p>Less common adverse reactions in ≤1% of patients who received Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> were hyperkalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypernatremia, tachycardia, hypertension, thrombophlebitis, vomiting, jaundice, rash and increased blood bilirubin.</p><h3>Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> in countries where it is registered. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily post-approval from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.</p><ul>

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span>, and any potential adverse effects of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> on the breastfed child or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> in pediatric patients has not been established. Deaths in preterm infants after infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion have been reported <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">]</span></span>.  Patients, particularly preterm infants, are at risk for aluminum toxicity <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]</span></span> .</p><p>Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of two years, including preterm infants, as the fixed content of the formulation does not meet the nutritional requirements of this age group due to the following reasons:</p><ul>
<li>Calcium and dextrose needs are not met and lipids, protein and magnesium exceed requirements.</li>
<li>The product does not contain the amino acids cysteine and taurine, considered conditionally essential for neonates and infants.</li>
</ul><p>Patients, including pediatric patients, may be at risk for PNALD <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics"> Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]</span></span> .</p><p>Newborns – especially those born premature and with low birth weight – are at increased risk of developing hypo – or hyperglycemia and therefore need close monitoring during treatment with intravenous dextrose  solutions to ensure adequate glycemic control in order to avoid potential long term adverse effects. Hypoglycemia in the newborn can cause prolonged seizures, coma and brain damage.<br/>
Hyperglycemia has been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, late onset bacterial and fungal infection, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, prolonged length of hospital stay, and death.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from other younger patients.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with impaired liver function Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered with caution.  Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to monitor liver function such as bilirubin and liver function parameters should be conducted <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[</span></span>s <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">ee Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span></span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with impaired renal function, Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered with caution.  Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to monitor renal function such as serum electrolytes (especially phosphate and potassium) and fluid balance should be conducted <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span></span> .</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdose, fat overload syndrome may result <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></span> .  Stop the infusion of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> to allow lipids to clear from serum. The effects are usually reversible after the lipid infusion is stopped. If medically appropriate, further intervention may be indicated.  The lipid administered and fatty acids produced are not dialyzable.</p><h2>Perikabiven Description</h2><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile, hypertonic emulsion, for peripheral or central venous administration, in a Three Chamber Bag. The product contains no added sulfites.</p><p>Chamber 1 contains Dextrose solution for fluid replenishment and caloric supply.</p><p>Chamber 2 contains the Amino Acid solution with Electrolytes, which comprises essential and nonessential amino acids provided with electrolytes.</p><p>Chamber 3 contains Intralipid <span class="Sup">®</span> 20% (a 20% Lipid Injectable Emulsion), prepared for intravenous administration as a source of calories and essential fatty acids.</p><p>See below for formulations of each chamber and Table 2 for strength, pH, osmolarity, ionic concentration and caloric content of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> when all the chambers are mixed together.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chamber 1:</span> Contains sterile, hypertonic solution of Dextrose, USP in water for injection with a pH range of 3.5 to 5.5.  Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate (C <span class="Sub">6</span>H <span class="Sub">12</span>O <span class="Sub">6</span> • H <span class="Sub">2</span>O) and has the following structure:</p><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Chamber 2:</span> Contains a sterile solution of amino acids and electrolytes in water for injection.  In addition, glacial acetic acid has been added to adjust the pH so that the final solution pH is 5.4 to 5.8.  The formulas for the individual electrolytes and amino acids are as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Chamber 3:</span> Contains a 20% Lipid Injectable Emulsion (Intralipid <span class="Sup">®</span> 20%) which is made up of 20% Soybean Oil, 1.2% Egg Yolk Phospholipids, 2.25% Glycerin, and water for injection. In addition, sodium hydroxide has been added to adjust the pH. The final product pH range is 6 to 9.</p><p>The soybean oil is a refined natural product consisting of a mixture of neutral triglycerides of predominantly unsaturated fatty acids with the following structure: <br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>where     are saturated and unsaturated fatty acid residues. The major component fatty acids are linoleic (48 to 58 %), oleic (17 to 30%), palmitic (9 to 13%), linolenic (5 to 11%) and stearic acid (2.5 to 5%). These fatty acids have the following chemical and structural formulas: </p><p>Purified egg phosphatides are a mixture of naturally occurring phospholipids which are isolated from the egg yolk. These phospholipids have the following general structure:</p><p> </p><p>  contain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids that abound in neutral fats. R3 is primarily either the choline or ethanolamine ester of phosphoric acid.</p><p></p><p>Glycerin is chemically designated C <span class="Sub">3</span>H <span class="Sub">8</span>O <span class="Sub">3</span> and is a clear colorless, hygroscopic syrupy liquid. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>  </p><p>The container-solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration.  The container is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional oxygen and moisture barrier when necessary.  An oxygen absorber is placed between the inner bag and the overpouch.</p><p>The container is not made with natural rubber latex or polyvinyl chloride (PVC).<br/>
Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum.</p><h2>Perikabiven - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is used as a supplement or as the sole source of nutrition in patients, providing macronutrients (amino acids, dextrose and lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes) parenterally. </p><p>The amino acids provide the structural units that make up proteins and are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy.</p><p>The administered dextrose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy.</p><p>Intravenously administered lipids provide a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids.  Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production.   The most common mechanism of action for energy derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta- oxidation.  Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The infused lipid particles provided by Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> are expected to be cleared from the blood stream in a manner thought to be comparable to the clearing of chylomicrons.  In healthy volunteers, the maximum clearance rate of the triglycerides after fasting overnight has been found to be 3.8 ± 1.5 g/kg per 24 hours. <br/>
Both elimination and oxidation rates are dependent on the patient's clinical condition; elimination is faster and utilization is increased in postoperative patients, in sepsis, burns and trauma, while patients with renal impairment and hypertriglyceridemia may show lower utilization of exogenous lipid emulsions. Due to differences in elimination, patients with these conditions should be closely monitored during Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> administration <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.11)]</span></span> .        </p><p>The disposition of infused amino acids, dextrose and electrolytes are essentially the same as those supplied by ordinary food. </p><p>A clinical study in healthy volunteers employing high intravenous doses (80 mmol) of either sodium glycerophosphate used in Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> or reference, inorganic sodium phosphate demonstrated that both compounds resulted in comparable serum inorganic phosphate concentrations after a single intravenous dose.  Changes from baseline in the serum levels of sodium, potassium and total calcium were comparable across the two phosphate sources in this study. </p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate carcinogenic potential of Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> or its effect on fertility. Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> to assess its mutagenic potential.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Perikabiven <span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile emulsion available in the following 3 sizes:</p><p><span class="Bold">NDC</span> <span class="Bold">Volume</span></p><p>63323-714-24              2,400 mL</p><p>63323-714-19              1,920 mL</p><p>63323-714-14              1,440 mL</p><p>Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized.
