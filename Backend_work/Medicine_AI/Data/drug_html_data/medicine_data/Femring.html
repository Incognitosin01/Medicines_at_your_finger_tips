Other vaginal estradiol products are used for treating vaginal menopause symptoms and symptoms that affect other parts of the body (such as hot flashes). This type of vaginal estradiol has "systemic" effects, meaning that it can affect parts of the body other than where the medicine is directly applied.</p><p>This medication guide provides information about Femring for systemic treatment of certain symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness, burning, or irritation.</p><p>Femring (systemic) may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  Femring if you have: undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease, a bleeding disorder, if you will have major surgery, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p><b>Do not use if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. <b>Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away.</b></p><p><b>Using this medicine can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, or cancer of the breast, uterus, or ovaries.</b> Estradiol should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use estradiol if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after inserting the vaginal ring.</p><p>You should not be able to feel the vaginal ring once it is in place. Leave the vaginal ring in place for 90 days, then remove it. Your doctor may want you to replace it with a new ring. The ring does not need to be removed during sexual intercourse. If the ring is bothersome, you may remove it, rinse it with warm water, and reinsert it after intercourse.</p><p>To remove the ring, loop a finger through the ring and gently pull it from the vagina. Call your doctor if you have trouble removing a vaginal ring.</p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. Call your doctor at once if you have any unusual vaginal bleeding while using  Femring.</p><p>Your doctor should check your progress on a regular basis (every 3 to 6 months) to determine whether you should continue this treatment. Self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis and have a mammogram every year while using estradiol.</p><p>If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest, you may need to stop using this medicine for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using estradiol.</p><p>Keep the vaginal ring in its protective pouch until you are ready to use it. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Remove the vaginal ring and insert a new one as soon as you remember. Do not use an extra vaginal ring to make up the missed wearing time.</p><p>If a vaginal ring falls out, rinse it with warm water and reinsert it. If it slides down into the lower part of the vagina, use your finger to push it in farther.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Femring?</h2><p><b>Avoid smoking.
