It is used together with carboplatin, a cancer medicine, to treat advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who cannot receive radiation therapy or have surgery. Paclitaxel protein-bound is used together with gemcitabine, a cancer medicine, to treat metastatic pancreas cancer.</p><p>Paclitaxel belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by paclitaxel, other unwanted effects will also occur.</p><p>Paclitaxel protein-bound is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using paclitaxel protein-bound</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For paclitaxel protein-bound, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to paclitaxel protein-bound or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of paclitaxel protein-bound injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of paclitaxel protein-bound injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects which may require caution in patients receiving paclitaxel protein-bound.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using paclitaxel protein-bound while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby.

If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p><i>Men who are receiving paclitaxel protein-bound should not father a child</i>. Paclitaxel protein-bound can harm the unborn baby of your partner.</p><p>Paclitaxel protein-bound may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving paclitaxel protein-bound.</p><p>Paclitaxel can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which will increase the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets in your blood, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, these are the precautions you can take to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection, or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or have painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in your urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor, fingernail clippers, or toenail clippers.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Paclitaxel protein-bound is made from donated human blood. Although the risk is low, some people have received viruses from human blood products. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses before the medicine is prepared. Talk with your doctor if this concerns you.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called sensory neuropathy.</p><p>Lung or breathing problems may occur if you are receiving paclitaxel protein-bound together with gemcitabine. Tell your doctor right away if you have shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or a persistent dry cough.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
