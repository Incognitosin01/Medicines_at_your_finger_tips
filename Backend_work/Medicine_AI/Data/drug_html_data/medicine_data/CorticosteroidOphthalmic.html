</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Ophthalmic corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines) are used to prevent permanent damage to the eye, which may occur with certain eye problems. They also provide relief from redness, irritation, and other discomfort.</p><p>Corticosteroids for use in the eye are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Children less than 2 years of age may be especially sensitive to the effects of ophthalmic corticosteroids. This may increase the chance of side effects. If this medicine has been ordered for a young child, you should discuss its use with your child's doctor. Be sure you follow all of the doctor's instructions very carefully.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information about the use of ophthalmic corticosteroids in the elderly, they are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than they do in younger adults.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Although studies on birth defects with ophthalmic corticosteroids have not been done in humans, these medicines have not been reported to cause birth defects or other problems. However, in animal studies, dexamethasone, fluorometholone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone caused birth defects when applied to the eyes of pregnant animals. Also, fluorometholone and medrysone caused other unwanted effects in the animal fetus.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Ophthalmic corticosteroids have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Cataracts—Corticosteroids may cause cataracts or make them worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes mellitus—Patients with diabetes may be more likely to develop cataracts or glaucoma with the use of corticosteroids.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Herpes infection of the eye or</li>
<li>Tuberculosis of the eye (active or history of) or</li>
<li>Any other eye infection—Ophthalmic corticosteroids may make existing infections worse or cause new infections.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p>For patients who wear <i>contact lenses</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Use of ophthalmic corticosteroids while you are wearing contact lenses (either hard lenses or soft lenses) may increase the chance of infection. Therefore, do not apply this medicine while you are wearing contact lenses. Also, check with an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) for advice on how long to wait after applying this medicine before inserting your contact lenses. It is possible that you may be directed not to wear contact lenses at all during the entire time of treatment and for a day or two after treatment has been stopped.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using an <i>ophthalmic solution or suspension</i> <i>(eye drop) form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>If you are using a suspension form of this medicine, always shake the container very well just before applying the eye drops.</li>
<li>To use:
<ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, use another drop.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the dropper or the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Always keep the container tightly closed.</li>

</ul><p>For patients using an <i>ointment form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into this space. A 1-cm (approximately ⅓ inch) strip of ointment is usually enough, unless you have been told by your doctor to use a different amount. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the irritation.</li>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into this space. A 1-cm (approximately 1/3 inch) strip of ointment is usually enough, unless you have been told by your doctor to use a different amount. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the irritation.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). After using the eye ointment, wipe the tip of the ointment tube with a clean tissue. Do not wash the tip with water. Always keep the tube tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p><i>Do not use corticosteroids more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered</i>. To do so may increase the chance of side effects, especially in children 2 years of age or younger.</p><p><i>Do not use any leftover medicine for future eye problems without first checking with your doctor</i>. This medicine should not be used if certain kinds of infections are present. To do so may make the infection worse and possibly lead to eye damage.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
