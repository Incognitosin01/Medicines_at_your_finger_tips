It should be noted that various forms of senna are available, and dosing is not equivalent across the doseforms; dosing for sennosides is not equivalent to dosing with other forms of senna (eg, senna extract). Caution should be used and package labeling consulted to ensure correct product-specific dosing.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>Senna products are known to interact with digoxin, warfarin, and diuretics.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>There are no reported adverse reactions.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Consumption of C. occidentalis seeds has been shown to be toxic in children.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Fabaceae</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>Coffee senna is a pantropical plant. It grows in open woodlands, waste areas, and road sides and is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world. It grows best in warm and humid conditions. The low-growing perennial plant produces yellow flowers with dark brown fruit and seeds.Parsons 2001, Senna 2018</p><h2>History</h2><p>Coffee senna plant originated in the Americas but is now present in all tropical parts of the world. The plant has traditionally been used for a wide variety of illnesses in India, China, and Jamaica but is considered an invasive species in most parts of the world.Brenan 1967, Senna 2018, Teem 1980 All parts of the plants can be used but its common name comes from use of the seeds as a coffee substitute, despite the fact that the seeds contain no caffeine.Senna 2018</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Coffee senna contains numerous chemical compounds concentrated in different parts of the plant. The flowers contain large amounts of emodin, physicion, and beta-glucopyranoside. The seeds contain numerous fatty acids (eg, linoleic and oleic acids) as well as phenolic and cyclic compounds (eg, islandicin, tannic acid). The leaves and roots also contain quinones such as bianthraquinone and chrysophanol.Cassia 2016</p><p>Coffee senna also contains high levels of iron and other vitamins and minerals.Manikandaselvi 2016</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Traditionally, coffee senna has been used as a diuretic, laxative, and blood purifier. It has also been used for treatment of hemorrhoids, rheumatism, gout, type 2 diabetes, whooping cough, convulsions, heart disease, snakebite, asthma, and the flu.Duke 2002</p><h3>Antianxiety/Antidepressant activity</h3><p>Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of coffee senna leaves have demonstrated antianxiety and antidepressant effects. In one study, rats and mice were given 500 mg/kg of either ethanolic or aqueous leaf extracts and then examined via swim and tail suspension tests. Rats and mice treated with the extracts had similar response times to those treated with diazepam and fluoxetine, with the ethanolic extract demonstrating more significant activity than the aqueous extract.Shafeen 2012</p><h3>Antibacterial activity</h3><p>An ethanolic extract of the roots of coffee senna was tested for antibacterial activity. When the compound emodin was identified and isolated, it demonstrated inhibitory effects against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.Chukwujekwu 2006</p><h3>Anticonvulsant activity</h3><p>The anticonvulsant activity of chloroform, alcoholic, and aqueous extracts of the entire coffee senna plant has been studied in rats. The chloroform extract was the most effective against electric shock and pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions, with anticonvulsant activity similar to phenytoin.Mahanthesh 2016</p><h3>Antidiabetic activity</h3><p>In a study evaluating the antidiabetic effects of an ethanolic extract of coffee senna (100 and 200 mg/kg) in rats, the extract caused a decrease in blood sugar levels in normal rats and in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. Treatment also restored growth of inlet cells in pancreatic tissue of diabetic rats.Verma 2010</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory/Analgesic activity</h3><p>The wound healing effects of coffee senna have been studied in mice with skin wounds induced using snake venom. C. occidentalis leaf material was extracted using 95% ethanol. Mice were treated with the extract incorporated into a topical cream base for 7 or 14 days. The extract produced a decrease in inflammation and aided with wound healing, suggesting potential use as a treatment of snakebite.Delmut 2013</p><p>The antinociceptive and antipyretic effects of coffee senna have been studied in mice. Ethanolic and water extracts of the leaves demonstrated dose-dependent effects on reduction of fever and pain-blocking tendencies at a dose of 300 mg/kg.Sini 2010</p><h3>CNS effects</h3><p>Because coffee senna lacks caffeine, the typical CNS effects of caffeine are not applicable.</p><h3>Laxative effects</h3><p>Coffee senna has been explored mainly as a laxative and preparative bowel cleanser for colonoscopies and surgeries and is available as nonprescription preparations. In one study, a Cassia senna preparation (X Prep [Sarget]) given prior to elective colorectal surgery was associated with significantly more effective intestinal cleanliness than polyethylene glycol.Valverde 1999 Another study demonstrated that use of senna solution (SennaS [Purdue Pharmaceuticals]) with docusate decreases time to first bowel movement in patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery and also reduces need for magnesium citrate.Patel 2010</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Dosage recommendations for coffee senna exist only for use as a laxative. The recommended dosage for sennosides in adults and children 12 years of age and older is 8.6 to 17.2 mg orally twice daily; in children 6 to 11 years, the recommended sennoside dosage is 8.6 mg orally once daily at bedtime.Hughes 2018 It should be noted that various forms of senna are available, and dosing is not equivalent across the doseforms. Dosing for sennosides is not equivalent to dosing with other forms of senna (eg, senna extract). Caution should be used and package labeling should be consulted to ensure correct product-specific dosing.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Coadministration of digoxin with senna may decrease exposure and action of digoxin.NCLFDA 2010 Senna-based laxatives can also interact with warfarin by increasing the risk of bleeding if diarrhea occurs.Kittisupamongkol 2008 Coffee senna, a known diuretic, should also not be taken with other diuretics, as it may overstimulate the gut or produce changes in potassium levels.NCLFDA 2010</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>There are no reported adverse reactions.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Consumption of anthraquinones from C. occidentalis seeds has been shown to be toxic in children and can cause hepatomyoencephalopathy. This effect does not appear to occur in adults, but has not been fully studied.Panigrahi 2015, Vashishtha 2009</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
