Water for Injection USP qs</p><p>pH: 5.0 (3.5–6.5); Calories per liter: 450<br/>
Calculated Osmolarity: 1125 mOsmol/liter, hypertonic</p><p>Each 100 mL of <span class="Bold">10% Alcohol and 5% Dextrose Injection USP</span> contains: Alcohol USP 10 mL; Hydrous Dextrose USP 5 g<br/>
Water for Injection USP qs</p><p>pH: 4.6 (3.5–6.5); Calories per liter: 720<br/>
Calculated Osmolarity: 1995 mOsmol/liter, strongly hypertonic</p><p>These intravenous solutions are sterile, nonpyrogenic, hypertonic and contain no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents.</p><p>The formulas of the active ingredients are:</p><h2>Alcohol and Dextrose - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP are an intravenous source of calories. In the average adult, pure ethyl alcohol is metabolized at a rate of 10 to 20 mL per hour. Sedative effects of alcohol occur if the rate of infusion exceeds the rate of metabolism. Dextrose (D-glucose) can be infused at a maximum rate of approximately 0.5 to 0.85 g/kg of body weight/hr without producing significant glycosuria. Thus, the maximum rate that alcohol can be infused without producing sedative effects is well below the maximum rate of utilization of dextrose.</p><p>Alcohol is metabolized, mostly in the liver, to acetaldehyde or acetate. The rate of oxidation is a linear function of time. Starvation lowers the rate of metabolism and insulin increases the rate.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Alcohol and Dextrose</h2><p class="First">Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP are indicated for increasing caloric intake.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Alcohol should not be used in patients with epilepsy, urinary tract infection, or diabetic coma.</p><p>Alcohol is contraindicated in patients who have been addicted to it.</p><p>Do not give subcutaneously and avoid extravasation during intravenous administration.</p><p>Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to corn products.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Alcohol should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients with liver impairment, in the presence of shock, following cranial surgery, in actual or anticipated postpartum hemorrhage, or in the presence of significant renal impairment.</p><p>Alcohol decreases blood sugar in diabetic patients. In the untreated diabetic, the rate of alcohol metabolism is slowed.</p><p>As a nutrient, alcohol supplies only calories. Given alone, it may cause or potentiate vitamin deficiencies and certain liver alterations.</p><p>Alcohol crosses the placenta rapidly and enters the fetal circulation. It may also be found in the milk of lactating women. The use of these solutions in pregnancy should be carefully considered.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP should be administered slowly, and the patient observed for restlessness or narcosis.</p><p>The half lives of phenytoin, warfarin and tolbutamide may be shortened 50% to 75% by concurrent administration of alcohol. Alcohol increases serum uric acid and can precipitate acute gout.</p><p>The vasodilating effect of alcohol may potentiate postural hypotension, particularly in association with some antihypertensive drugs.</p><p>If the administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.</p><p>To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.</p><p>Use only if solution is clear and vacuum is present.</p><h3>Usage in Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP. It is also not known whether Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Alcoholic intoxication may occur with too rapid infusion. Vertigo, flushing, disorientation (especially in elderly patients), or sedation may also occur. An alcoholic odor may be noted in the breath. Generally, these effects can be avoided by slowing the rate of infusion.</p><p>Too rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and, rarely, vein irritation. Use of the largest available peripheral vein and a well-placed, small bore needle is recommended.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of fluid overload during parenteral therapy, reevaluate the patient's condition, and institute appropriate corrective treatment.</p><h2>Alcohol and Dextrose Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP are administered by intravenous infusion only. Total dosage and rate of infusion depend on the patient's response and tolerance. The average adult can metabolize approximately 10 mL of pure alcohol per hour, equivalent to the alcohol contained in 200 mL of a 5% solution or 100 mL of a 10% solution. The usual adult dosage is 1 to 2 liters and rarely exceeds 3 liters of a 5% solution in a 24-hour period. Children may be given 40 mL per kg per 24 hours or from 350 mL to 1000 mL depending on size and clinical response.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>How is Alcohol and Dextrose Supplied</h2><p class="First">These solutions are supplied sterile and nonpyrogenic in single dose glass containers packaged 6 per case.</p><p>Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized. Avoid excessive heat. Protect from freezing. It is recommended that the product be stored at room temperature (25°C); however, brief exposure up to 40°C does not adversely affect the product.</p><p class="First">Rx only</p><p>Revised: June 1999</p><h2>Directions for Use of B. Braun Glass Containers</h2><p class="First">Before use, perform the following checks:</p><p class="First">Before removing the latex disk, add medication through the triangular () medication site (See Figure 4). The vacuum in the container will automatically draw the contents of a syringe or spiked vial into the container. Each addition/transfer will reduce the vacuum remaining in the bottle.</p><p><span class="Bold">Warning:</span> Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly.<br/>
