Ganciclovir capsules are indicated only for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection at risk for CMV disease, for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis in immunocompromised patients, and for prevention of CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. Because ganciclovir is associated with a risk of more rapid rate of CMV retinitis progression, it should be used as maintenance treatment only in those patients for whom this risk is balanced by the benefit associated with avoiding daily IV infusions .</p><p>Granulocytopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been reported in patients treated with ganciclovir sodium. Based on animal data and limited human data, ganciclovir sodium may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males and suppression of fertility in females. Based on animal data, ganciclovir sodium has the potential to cause birth defects in humans. Based on animal data, ganciclovir sodium has the potential to cause cancers in humans .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
