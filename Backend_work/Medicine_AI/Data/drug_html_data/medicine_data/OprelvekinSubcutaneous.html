Naturally occurring interleukin-11 is produced by bone marrow cells in the body and helps to make platelets, which are necessary for proper clotting of blood. Oprelvekin is used to help prevent low platelet counts caused by treatment with some cancer medicines.</p><p>Oprelvekin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using oprelvekin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For oprelvekin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to oprelvekin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Oprelvekin has caused joint and tendon problems in animals and there is a possibility it could also cause these effects in children receiving it. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Oprelvekin has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of oprelvekin. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Congestive heart failure—May be worsened because oprelvekin causes the body to retain water</li>

<li>Fluid build-up in the abdomen or lungs—May be worsened by oprelvekin</li>
<li>Myeloablative chemotherapy— May lead to serious side effects</li>

Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of oprelvekin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>If you miss a dose of oprelvekin, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.
