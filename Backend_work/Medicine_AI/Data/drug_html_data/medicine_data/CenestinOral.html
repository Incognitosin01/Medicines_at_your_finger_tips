Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy may reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. However, addition of a progestin to estrogen therapy may increase the risk of invasive breast cancer. Undertake adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling if indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Estrogen treatment alone increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), while estrogen plus progestin increased risks of stroke, DVT, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary emboli in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age). Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. An increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older has also been reported. Prescribe estrogen with or without progestins at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
