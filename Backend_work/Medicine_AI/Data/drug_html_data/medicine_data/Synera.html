Lidocaine and tetracaine are local anesthetics (numbing medicines). They work by blocking nerve signals in your body.</p><p>Synera patches are used to numb a small area of your skin. This can help prevent pain during certain medical procedures such as a skin biopsy, minor skin surgery, insertion of an intravenous (IV) needle, or other needle-stick procedures.</p><p>Synera patches are also used to numb a skin area during minor cosmetic procedures such as a Botox injection, laser treatment, or tattoo removal.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>An overdose of numbing medicine can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin.</b> This can happen if you apply more than the recommended dose, or if you leave a Synera skin patch on too long.</p><p>Keep both used and unused Synera skin patches out of the reach of children or pets.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Synera if you are allergic to:</p><ul>
