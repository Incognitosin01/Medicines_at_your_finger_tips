</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients, or to tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(12.1)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.</p><h3>Bladder Outlet Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(4)</span>].</p><h3>Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation.</p><h3>Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, and only where the potential benefits outweigh the risks [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(4)</span>].</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous sytem (CNS) effects <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse</span> <span class="Italics">Reactions</span> <span class="Italics">(6.2)].</span> A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore is not recommended for use in this patient population [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Use</span> <span class="Italics">in</span> <span class="Italics">Specific</span> <span class="Italics">Populations</span> <span class="Italics">(8.7)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Use</span> <span class="Italics">In</span> <span class="Italics">Specific</span> <span class="Italics">Populations</span> <span class="Italics">(8.6)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>].</p><h3>Concomitant Administration with CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients taking a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin).</p><p>No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice).</p><p>While the effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined by clinical study, some pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, albeit less than that observed with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug</span> <span class="Italics">Interactions</span> <span class="Italics">(7.2)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>].</p><h3>Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience:</h3><p class="First">The safety of fesoterodine fumarate was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2288 were treated with fesoterodine. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day in Phase 2 or 3 studies with treatment periods of 8 or 12 weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had &gt; 10 weeks exposure to fesoterodine fumarate in these trials.</p><p>A total of 1964 patients participated in two 12 week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day.</p><p>In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse event each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG.</p><p>The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment.</p><p>The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day.</p><p>Table 1 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4 or 8 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.</p><p class="First Footnote">ALT = alanine aminotransferase; GGT = gamma glutamyltransferase</p><p>Patients also received fesoterodine fumarate for up to three years in open-label extension phases of one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 controlled trials. In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12 week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following events have been reported in association with fesoterodine use in worldwide postmarketing experience:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Eye</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">disorders</span></span></p><p>Blurred vision;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiac</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">disorders</span></span> </p><p>Palpitations;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">disorders</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">and</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">administrative</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">site</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">conditions</span></span></p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Central</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">nervous</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">system</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">disorders</span></span></p><p>Dizziness, headache, somnolence;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">and</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">subcutaneous</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">tissue</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">disorders</span></span></p><p>Urticaria, pruritus</p><p>Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide postmarketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of fesoterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Antimuscarinic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility.</p><h3>CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin. Coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(12.3)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.8)</span>, <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>].</p><p>There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice).</p><p>The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(12.3)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.8)</span>, <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>].</p><h3>CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First">No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed.</p><h3>CYP2D6 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively.</p><p>No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p><h3>Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In</span> <span class="Italics">vitro</span> data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There are no data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk for birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day based on AUC <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre-and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F1 dams or on the F2 offspring.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine have not been evaluated in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age.</p><p>Of 1567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day or 8 mg/day in the Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies; however, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse events, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (at 8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Studies</span> <span class="Italics">(14)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse</span> <span class="Italics">Reactions</span> <span class="Italics">(6)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with severe renal impairment (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt; 30 mL/min), C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects.

In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.6)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>].</p><h3>Gender</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is recommended based on gender. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by gender.</p><h3>Race</h3><p class="First">Available data indicate that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine between Caucasian and Black healthy subjects following administration of fesoterodine fumarate.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage with fesoterodine fumarate can result in severe anticholinergic effects. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. In the event of overdosage, ECG monitoring is recommended.</p><h2>Fesoterodine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet contains fesoterodine fumarate. Fesoterodine is rapidly de-esterified to its active metabolite (R)-2-(3-diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-4-hydroxymethyl-phenol, or 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is a muscarinic receptor antagonist.</p><p>Chemically, fesoterodine fumarate is designated as isobutyric acid 2-((R)-3-diisopropylammonium-1-phenylpropyl)-4-(hydroxymethyl) phenyl ester hydrogen fumarate. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">30</span>H<span class="Sub">41</span>NO<span class="Sub">7</span> and its molecular weight is 527.66. The structural formula is:</p><p>The asterisk (*) indicates the chiral carbon.</p><p>Fesoterodine fumarate is a white to off-white powder which is freely soluble in water and methanol.</p><p>Each fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet contains either 4 mg or 8 mg of fesoterodine fumarate and the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, lecithin, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, talc, titanium dioxide and xanthan gum. Additionally each 4 mg tablets contain iron oxide yellow.</p><h2>Fesoterodine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine and is also one of the active moieties of tolterodine tartrate tablets and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules.</p><p>Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiac</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Electrophysiology</span></span> </p><p>The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24 hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia's correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24 hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin.</p><p>Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. In the study described above, when compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with a dose of 4 mg/day and 28 mg/day of fesoterodine was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively.</p><p>In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo was approximately 3 to 4 beats/minute in the 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the 8 mg/day group.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%.
