It is primarily used as a sedative hypnotic and also as an anticonvulsant in subhypnotic doses.</p><p>Atropine Sulfate, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, and Scopolamine are belladonna alkaloids classified as anticholinergic, antimuscarinic drugs. They act to inhibit muscarinic actions of acetylcholine at postganglionic parasympathetic neuron effector sites. These drugs are also used as antispasmodics due to their anticholinergic action. They produce the effect in the body of reduced muscle spasms in the digestive or urinary tract, and reduced fluid secretions from certain glands or organs.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Phenohytro Elixir</h2><p class="First">Based on the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council's review of this drug and/or other information, FDA has classified the following indications as "possibly" effective: For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis. May also be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.</p><p>IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN CONCLUSIVELY WHETHER ANTICHOLINERGIC / ANTISPASMODIC DRUGS AID IN THE HEALING OF A DUODENAL ULCER, DECREASE THE RATE OF RECURRENCES, OR PREVENT COMPLICATIONS.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">PHENOHYTRO<span class="Sup">®</span> ELIXIR is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in patients with acute intermittent porphyria and in those patients in which phenobarbital produces restlessness and/or excitement.</p><p>PHENOHYTRO<span class="Sup">®</span> ELIXIR is also contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, obstructive uropathy; paralytic ileus; myasthenia gravis; intestinal atony; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis especially if complicated by toxic megacolon; hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis; obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract; or severe ulcerative colitis.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids in high temperatures.</p><p>Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, particularly in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug could be harmful.</p><p>PHENOHYTRO<span class="Sup">®</span> ELIXIR may produce drowsiness and blurred vision. The patient should be warned about engaging in hazardous work or activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery.</p><p>Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and larger doses of the anticoagulant may be necessary for optimal effect. When phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased.</p><p><span class="Bold">Phenobarbital may be habit forming</span> and should not be administered to patients who are susceptible to addiction or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological drug dependence.</p><p>Barbiturates should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>GENERAL</h3><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, and hypertension.</p><p>Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis), which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer.</p><p>Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, a curare-like action may occur with overdosage.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PHENOHYTRO<span class="Sup">®</span> ELIXIR.
