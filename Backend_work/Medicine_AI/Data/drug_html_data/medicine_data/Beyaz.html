Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary) and also cause changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus. Levomefolate is a type of B vitamin that helps prevent a rare birth defect that could occur in a baby if pregnancy occurs while taking birth control pills or shortly after stopping them.</p><p>Beyaz is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Beyaz is also used to treat moderate acne in women who are at least 14 years old and have started having menstrual periods, and who wish to use birth control pills.</p><p>Beyaz is also used to treat the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), such as anxiety, depression, irritability, trouble concentrating, lack of energy, sleep or appetite changes, breast tenderness, joint or muscle pain, headache, and weight gain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Beyaz if you are pregnant or if you recently had a baby.</b></p><p><b>You should not take Beyaz if you have:</b> an adrenal gland disorder, kidney disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, coronary artery disease, circulation problems (especially with diabetes), undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, severe migraine headaches, if you also take certain hepatitis C medication, if you will have major surgery, if you smoke and are over 35, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, jaundice caused by pregnancy or birth control pills, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p>Taking Beyaz can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not take Beyaz if you smoke and are over 35 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Beyaz side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Beyaz</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Stop using Beyaz and call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
