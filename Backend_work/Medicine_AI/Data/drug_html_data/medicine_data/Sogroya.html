</ul><p>Keep Sogroya and all medicines out of the reach of children.</p><h2>General information about the safe and effective use of Sogroya.</h2><p>Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use Sogroya  for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give Sogroya to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about Sogroya that is written for health professionals.</p><h2>What are the ingredients in Sogroya?</h2><p><strong>Active ingredient:</strong> somapacitan-beco<br/>
<strong>Inactive ingredients:</strong> histidine, mannitol, phenol, poloxamer 188, Water for Injection, and hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (as needed)</p><h2>Instructions for Use</h2><p><strong>Step 1. Prepare your Sogroya Pen</strong></p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Check the name, strength, and colored label on your Pen to make sure that it contains Sogroya in the right strength.</li>
<li>Pull off the Pen cap.</li>
<li>Turn the Pen upside down 1 or 2 times to check that the Sogroya in your<br/>
Pen is clear to almost clear and colorless to slightly yellow. If Sogroya looks cloudy, do not use the Pen.</li>
<li>When you are ready to give your injection, get a new disposable needle, and remove the paper tab.</li>
<li>Push the needle straight onto the Pen.</li>
<li>Turn the needle clockwise until it is on tight.</li>
</ul><p>Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing.</p><ul>
<li>Pull off the outer needle cap and throw it away (dispose of)</li>
<li>Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of)</li>
<li>A drop of Sogroya may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the Sogroya flow with each new Pen (See Step 2).</li>
<li>Never use a bent or damaged needle.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 2. Check the Sogroya flow with each new Pen</strong></p><p>If your Pen is already in use, go to Step 3.</p><ul>
<li>Before using a new Pen, check the Sogroya flow to make sure the growth hormone can flow through the Pen and needle.</li>
<li>Turn the dose selector clockwise 1 marking on the dose counter to select 0.05 mg. You may hear a faint “click” when you turn the dose selector. </li>
<li>1 marking on the dose counter equals 0.05 mg.</li>
<li>Hold the Pen with the needle pointing up. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to “0”. The “0” must line up with the dose pointer.</li>
<li>Check that a drop of Sogroya appears at the needle tip.</li>
</ul><p>If no Sogroya appears, repeat Step 2 up to 6 times.<br/>
<br/>
If you still do not see a drop of Sogroya, change the needle:</p><ul>
<li>Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise. Place the needle in a<br/>
sharps disposal container immediately</li>
<li>Repeat Step 2 again.</li>
</ul><p>Do not use the Pen if a drop of Sogroya still does not appear after changing the needle and repeating Step 2. Call Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444<br/>
for help.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 3. Select your dose</strong></p><ul>
<li>To start, check that the dose pointer is set at “0”.</li>
<li>Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you need. When you have selected your dose, you can go to Step 4.</li>
</ul><p>If there is not enough Sogroya left to select a full dose, see Frequently Asked Questions.<br/>
<br/>
The dose counter shows the dose in “mg”. Always use the dose counter to select the exact dose. Do not use the “click” sounds you hear when you turn the dose selector to select your dose. Only the dose pointer on the dose counter will show the exact dose selected.<br/>
<br/>
If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct dose.<br/>
The Pen “clicks” sound and feel differently when the dose selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you forcefully move it past the number of “mg” left in the Pen.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 4. Inject your dose</strong></p><ul>
<li>Select the injection site.</li>
<li>Sogroya can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper legs (thighs) as instructed by your healthcare provider. Change the injection site every week.</li>
<li>Wipe the injection site with an alcohol pad and let the area dry.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into your skin as your healthcare provider has shown you.</li>
<li>Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers. This could block the injection.</li>
<li>Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows “0”. The “0” must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a “click”.</li>
<li>Continue to hold the needle in your skin. If “0” does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, your needle may be blocked or damaged. See Frequently Asked Questions.</li>
<li>Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to “0”. Count slowly to 6 to make sure that the full dose has been delivered.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the needle from your skin. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area.</li>
</ul><p>You may see a drop of Sogroya at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 5. After your injection</strong></p><ul>
<li>Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise.</li>
<li>Place the needle in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container immediately to reduce the risk of a needle stick.</li>
</ul><p>Always throw away (dispose of) the needle after each injection.<br/>
For further information about safe sharps disposal, see Frequently Asked Questions.<br/>
Do not try to put the needle cap back on. You may stick yourself with the needle.</p><ul>
<li>Put the Pen cap on your Pen after each use to protect Sogroya from direct light.</li>
</ul><p>See <em>How should I store Sogroya?</em></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>How do I see how much Sogroya is left in my Pen?</strong><br/>
The Pen scale shows you approximately how much Sogroya is left in your Pen. To see how much Sogroya is left in your Pen, use the dose counter:<br/>
Turn the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. The dose pointer will line up with the number of “mg” left in the Pen. You can select a maximum dose of 4.0 mg. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with “4.0”, at least 4.0 mg are left in your Pen. If the dose counter stops with the dose<br/>
pointer lined up with “2.8”, only 2.8 mg are left in your Pen.</p><p><strong>What if I need a larger dose than what is left in my Pen?</strong><br/>
It is not possible to select a larger dose on the dose counter than the number of “mg” left in your Pen. If you need more Sogroya than you have left in your Pen, you can use a new Pen or split your dose between your current Pen and a new Pen. Only split your dose if you have been trained or advised by your healthcare provider on how to do this. You may find it helpful to use a calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your healthcare provider.<br/>
<br/>
Be very careful to calculate your split dose correctly so that you do not give the wrong dose. If you are not sure how to split your dose using 2 Pens, then select and inject the dose you need with a new Pen.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What if no Sogroya appears when I check the flow?</strong><br/>
A. Your needle may be blocked or damaged, if no Sogroya appears at the needle tip. Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 and Step 2.<br/>
B. Your Pen may be defective, if Sogroya still does not appear after changing the needle. Do not use the Pen. Contact Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What if “0” does not appear after completing my injection?</strong><br/>
The needle may be blocked or damaged, and you have not received any Sogroya, even though the dose counter has moved from the dose that you have set. Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 to Step 4.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How should I take care of my Pen?</strong><br/>
Be careful not to drop your Pen or knock it against hard surfaces. Do not expose your Pen to dust, dirt, liquid, or direct light. See <em>How should I store Sogroya?</em> Do not try to refill your Pen, it is prefilled.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What if I drop my Pen?</strong><br/>
If you drop your Pen or think that something is wrong with it, attach a new disposable needle and check the Sogroya flow before you inject (See Step 1 and Step 2). Do not try to repair your Pen or pull it apart.</p><p><strong>How do I clean my Pen?</strong><br/>
Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your Pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a moistened cloth.</p><p><strong>How do I throw away (dispose of) used Sogroya needles and Pens?</strong><br/>
Put your used needles and Pens in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and Pens in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:</p><ul>
<li>made of a heavy-duty plastic,</li>
<li>can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,</li>
<li>upright and stable during use,</li>
<li>leak-resistant, and</li>
<li>properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. </li>
</ul><p>When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should dispose of used needles and Pens. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about safe sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA’s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.<br/>
