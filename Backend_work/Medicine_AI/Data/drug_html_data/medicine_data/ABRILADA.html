It is used in children 2 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This medicine is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Psoriatic arthritis usually occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Adalimumab may be used alone or in combination with medicines (eg, methotrexate or DMARDs).</p><p>Adalimumab injection is also used to treat the symptoms of active Crohn's disease in patients who have not been helped by other medicines, such as infliximab. It is also used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in patients who have been treated with other medicines (eg, azathioprine, corticosteroids, or 6-mercaptopurine) that did not work well.</p><p>Adalimumab injection may also be used to treat chronic plaque psoriasis, which is a skin disease with red patches and white scales that do not go away. It is also used to treat moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic skin disease that has small, painful lumps under the skin in adults and children 12 years of age and older. This medicine is also used to treat non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults and children 2 years of age and older.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ABRILADA</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab injection for the <i>treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and non-infectious uveitis in children 2 years of age and older</i> or for the <i>treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in children 12 years of age and older</i>. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and non-infectious uveitis, in children younger than 6 years of age for Crohn's disease, in children younger than 12 years of age for hidradenitis suppurativa, and in children for other conditions.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab injection in the elderly. However, this medicine may cause serious infections and cancer more often in the elderly, which may require caution in patients receiving adalimumab injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

This will allow your doctor to see if this medicine is working properly and to decide whether you should continue to use it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>Adalimumab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which may increase the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. <i>Using abatacept (Orencia®) or anakinra (Kineret®) together with this medicine may increase your risk of having serious side effects</i>.</p><p>This medicine may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after this medicine is used.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pains, joint pain, or a rash on the cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.</p><p>Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab. Your child's vaccines need to be current before using adalimumab. Be sure to ask your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.</p><p>The needle cover of some prefilled syringes and pens contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex.
