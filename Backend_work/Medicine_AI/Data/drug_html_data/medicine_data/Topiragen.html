This medicine will not cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to take it. It is also used to help prevent migraine headaches.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Topiragen</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of topiramate <i>capsules or tablets</i>, or <i>Qudexy® extended-release capsules</i> to treat seizures in children younger than 2 years of age (when used alone or together with other medicines). Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Trokendi™ extended-release capsules</i> for the treatment of seizures in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of topiramate <i>capsules, extended-release capsules, or tablets</i> for the prevention of migraine headaches in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of topiramate have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of topiramate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving topiramate.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
