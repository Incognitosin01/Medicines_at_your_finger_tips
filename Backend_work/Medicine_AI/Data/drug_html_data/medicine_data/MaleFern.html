</ul><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Scientific Name(s):</b> Dryopteris filix-mas (L.) Schott, Dryopteris marginalis (L)<br/><b>Common Name(s):</b> Aspidium, Bear's paw, Knotty brake, Male fern, Marginal fern, Shield fern, Worm fern</p><h2>Clinical Overview</h2><h3>Use</h3><p>D. filix-mas has been used as a traditional vermifuge. Investigations into potential applications of related species, particularly Dryopteris crassirhizoma and Dracaena fragrans, report antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, but no clinical trials support these claims.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Clinical evidence does not support specific doses of male fern, and toxicities have been reported with traditional doses.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Male fern extract is potentially toxic.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented. Traditional use of male fern extract combined with castor oil increases absorption of the extract, resulting in enhanced toxicity.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Adverse reactions associated with traditional doses have included headache, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, vertigo, tremors, convulsions, and cardiac and respiratory failure. Impaired vision and jaundice have also been reported.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Male fern extract is potentially toxic.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Dryopteridaceae</li><li>Polypodiaceae (wood fern)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>D. filix-mas is a hardy, ornamental fern with semievergreen leaves that can grow up to 1 m in length. Stalks are scaly and pale brown and each leaf grows from the root base. Its rhizomes and frond bases are used medicinally. The plant grows throughout the United States in dry terrain, in rich woods, and on rocky slopes. Originally thought to be the male plant of Athyrium filix-femina (female fern), it was given the name "<i>filix-mas</i>."Franchi 1988, Khan 2009, Step 1905, USDA 2015</p><h2>History</h2><p>Male fern has been used in traditional medicine as a vermifuge ("worm fern"), with the early Greeks and Romans also recognizing the plant’s value in destroying or expelling parasitic worms.Franchi 1988 In Chinese medicine, the extract has been used to treat wounds, recurrent nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual bleeding. The components of the plant have also been used as veterinary vermifuges. D. Filix-mas formerly listed in the <i>United States Pharmacopeia</i> (<i>USP</i>).Khan 2009</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Major constituents of Dryopteris ferns include flavonoids and terpenoids.Cao 2013, Han 2015 Male fern contains approximately 6% to 15% of an oleoresin, which contains several chemical constituents including filicins (filicic/filixic acid, albaspidin, flavaspidic acid), aspidinol, alkanes, triterpene hydrocarbons, lignins, volatile oils, and resins.Franchi 1988, Khan 2009 Margaspidin, para-aspidin, phloraspin, and other constituents have also been described.Han 2015, Khan 2009</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Vermifuge</h3><p>Filicin and filmarone are active vermifuges, particularly toxic to tapeworms.Duke 2002, Khan 2009</p><p>An older clinical study examined the anthelmintic effects of male fern administered via intubation as compared with the effects of piperazine.Goodwin 1958 Another study examined male fern's anthelmintic properties using the plant's encapsulated extract in combination with a pretreatment of magnesium sulfate solution.Mello 1978</p><h3>Other Effects</h3><p>Antioxidant, antimicrobial, and chemotherapeutic properties of related fern species, particularly D. crassirhizoma and D. fragrans, have been investigated.Cao 2013, Gao 2015, Han 2015, Huang 2014, Jiang 2013, Kwon 2007, Lee 2008, Lu 2012, Magalhães 2010, Mazzio 2009, Sun 2013, Xie 2015, Zhang 2012, Zhao 2014</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical evidence does not support specific doses of male fern. Traditional dosage of the plant as an anthelmintic was 5 to 8 g oleoresin extract; however, adverse effects at this dosage have been documented.Duke 2002</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented. Traditional use of male fern extract combined with castor oil increases absorption of the extract, resulting in enhanced toxicity.Khan 2009</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Therapeutic doses have been associated with adverse events,Duke 2002, Hargreaves 1966, Khan 2009 including headache, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, vertigo, tremors, convulsions, and cardiac and respiratory failure.Khan 2009 Impaired vision and jaundice have also been reported.Duke 2002, Hargreaves 1966</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Male fern extract is potentially toxic,Duke 2002, Hargreaves 1966, Khan 2009 and references in the <i>USP</i> have been removed.Franchi 1988, Khan 2009 Some consumer websites reference a 1976 German report of penis enlargement in rats with the use of D. filix-mas extract, but the effect has not been explained or further elucidated.Kantemir 1976</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
