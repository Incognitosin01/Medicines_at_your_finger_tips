Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>Levalbuterol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using levalbuterol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For levalbuterol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to levalbuterol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of levalbuterol <i>solution</i> and <i>solution concentrate</i> in children younger than 6 years of age, and levalbuterol <i>aerosol</i> in children younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levalbuterol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving levalbuterol.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking levalbuterol, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using levalbuterol with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of levalbuterol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

<li>Heart disease or</li>
<li>Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia, QT prolongation) or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure) or</li>
<li>Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or</li>
<li>Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of levalbuterol</h2><p><i>Use levalbuterol only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using levalbuterol or any other asthma medicine that you are taking without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance for breathing problems.</p><p>The levalbuterol <i>inhalation solution</i> and <i>inhalation solution concentrate</i> should be used with a jet nebulizer that is connected to an air compressor with good air flow. The inhalation solution and nebulizer will come with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>To use the <i>inhalation solution or solution concentrate in the nebulizer</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Open the pouch and remove one vial.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the vial. It should be clear or colorless. Do not use it if is discolored.</li>
<li>Open the vial and place the inhalation solution in the medicine reservoir or nebulizer cup on the machine. If you are using the solution concentrate, mix it first with sterile normal saline before placing it on the reservoir.</li>
<li>Connect the nebulizer to the face mask or mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Use the face mask or mouthpiece to breathe in the medicine.</li>
<li>Use the nebulizer for about 5 to 15 minutes, or until the medicine in the nebulizer cup is gone.</li>
<li>Clean all the parts of the nebulizer after each use.</li>
<li>Do not use if solution becomes cloudy.</li>
<li>Do not mix another inhalation medicine with levalbuterol in the nebulizer, unless told to do so by your doctor.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using <i>levalbuterol inhalation aerosol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The levalbuterol aerosol canister provides about 200 inhalations, depending on the size of the canister your doctor ordered. You should try to keep a record of the number of inhalations you use so you will know when the canister is almost empty. This canister, unlike some other aerosol canisters, cannot be floated in water to test its fullness.</li>
<li>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it in a while, the inhaler may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Test or prime the inhaler before using it.</li>
<li>Shake the inhaler well immediately before each use.</li>
<li>Take the cap off the actuator (or mouthpiece). Inspect the actuator for the presence of foreign objects and make sure that the canister is seated in the actuator before each use.</li>
<li>Prime the inhaler by releasing 4 test sprays in the air, away from your face. The inhaler will now be ready to provide the right amount of medicine when you use it.</li>
<li>Breathe out fully through your mouth, expelling as much air from your lungs as possible. Place the mouthpiece fully into your mouth, holding the inhaler in the mouthpiece-down position and closing your lips around it.</li>
<li>While breathing in deeply and slowly through your mouth, fully depress the top of the metal canister with your middle finger. Immediately after the puff is delivered, release your finger from the canister and remove the inhaler from your mouth.</li>
<li>Hold your breath for 10 seconds, if possible.</li>
<li>If your doctor has prescribed more than a single inhalation/puff, wait 1 minute between inhalations. Then, shake the inhaler well and repeat.</li>
<li>Replace the cap on the mouthpiece after each use.</li>
<li>Clean the actuator or mouthpiece at least once a week.</li>
<li>Wash the actuator through the top and bottom with warm running water for 30 seconds at least once a week.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of levalbuterol will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of levalbuterol. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
