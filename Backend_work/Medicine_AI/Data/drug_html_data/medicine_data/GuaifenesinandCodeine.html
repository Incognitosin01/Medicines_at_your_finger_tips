PHENobarbital may decrease the serum concentration of Codeine. Management: Avoid use of codeine and phenobarbital when possible. Monitor for respiratory depression/sedation.

This could result in serotonin syndrome. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Opioid Agonists (metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6).  Management: Monitor for decreased therapeutic response (eg, analgesia) and opioid withdrawal when coadministered with SSRIs that strongly inhibit CYP2D6.

The risk is increased in elderly patients, debilitated patients, and patients with conditions associated with hypoxia, hypercapnia, or upper airway obstruction.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Abdominal conditions: May obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><p>• Adrenal insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease.</p><p>• Biliary tract impairment: Use with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction or acute pancreatitis.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and ischemic heart disease).</p><p>• CNS depression/coma: Avoid use in patients with CNS depression or coma as these patients are susceptible to intracranial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> retention.</p><p>• Delirium tremens: Use with caution in patients with delirium tremens.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes.</p><p>• Head trauma: Use with extreme caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure; exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary obstruction: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or GU obstruction.</p><p>• Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>• Seizure disorder: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Cachectic or debilitated patients: Use with caution in cachectic or debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for critical respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>• CYP2D6 “ultrarapid metabolizers”: Use caution in patients with two or more copies of the variant CYP2D6*2 allele; may have extensive conversion from codeine to morphine and thus increased opioid-mediated effects. Avoid the use of codeine in these patients; consider alternative analgesics such as morphine or a nonopioid agent (Crews 2012). The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in 0.5% to 1% of Chinese and Japanese, 0.5% to 1% of Hispanics, 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% of African-Americans, and 16% to 28% of North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; may be more sensitive to adverse effects.</p><p>• Pediatric: Respiratory depression may occur even at therapeutic dosages; FDA and AAP recommend against use in pediatric patients &lt;18 years due to risk of adverse effects (AAP 2018; FDA 2018a; FDA 2018b). Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine due to a CYP-450 2D6 polymorphism. Codeine is contraindicated in pediatric patients &lt;12 years of age and pediatric patients &lt;18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy<i>. </i>Avoid the use of codeine in pediatric patients 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. Deaths have also occurred in breastfeeding infants after being exposed to high concentrations of morphine because the mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Abuse/misuse/diversion: Use with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists.</p><p>• Administration: Use an accurate measuring device; a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, which can result in serious adverse reactions.</p><p>• Cough: Appropriate use: Underlying cause of cough should be determined prior to prescribing. Dose should not be increased if cough does not respond.</p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): Prior to self-medication (OTC), notify health care provider if you have a cough that occurs with excessive phlegm, and/or a chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. Discontinue use and notify healthcare provider if nervousness, dizziness, or sleepiness occurs; new symptoms occur; or if cough lasts &gt;7 days, returns or is accompanied by fever, rash or persistent headache.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Relief of symptoms; respiratory and mental status; signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to thin mucus so it can be taken from the body by coughing.</p><p>• It is used to relieve coughing.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
