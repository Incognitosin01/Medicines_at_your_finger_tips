Depo-Provera Contraceptive also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Depo-Provera Contraceptive is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. It is also used to reduce pain caused by endometriosis.</p><p>Depo-Provera Contraceptive may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>You should not use Depo-Provera Contraceptive if you have:</b> undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease, breast cancer, if you are pregnant, or if you have ever had a stroke or blood clot.</p><p>Depo-Provera Contraceptive can decrease the calcium stored in your bones, which may cause bone loss (osteoporosis) when the medicine is used over long periods of time. Bone loss may not be reversible.</p><p>You may be more likely to have a broken bone if your bones get weak from calcium loss, especially after menopause. You should not use this medicine for longer than 2 years unless other birth control methods are not right for you.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before you start  Depo-Provera Contraceptive.</p><p>You should not use Depo-Provera Contraceptive if you are pregnant, or if you have:</p><ul>
