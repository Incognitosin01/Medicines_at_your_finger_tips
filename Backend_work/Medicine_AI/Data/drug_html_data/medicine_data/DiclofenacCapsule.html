</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Diclofenac Capsule</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac Capsules is indicated for:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Management of mild to moderate acute pain</li>
<li>Management of osteoarthritis pain</li>
</ul><h2>Diclofenac Capsule Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Instructions</h3><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Diclofenac Capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use Diclofenac Capsules. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>].</p><p>The effectiveness of Diclofenac Capsules when taken with food has not been studied in clinical studies. Taking Diclofenac Capsules with food may cause a reduction in effectiveness compared to taking Diclofenac Capsules on an empty stomach [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acute Pain</span></p><p>For management of mild to moderate acute pain, the dosage is 18 mg or 35 mg orally three times daily.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Osteoarthritis Pain</span></p><p>For management of osteoarthritis pain, the dosage is 35 mg orally three times daily.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of Diclofenac Capsules compared to patients with normal hepatic function [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>]. As with other diclofenac products, start treatment at the lowest dose. If efficacy is not achieved with the lowest dose, discontinue use.</p><h3>Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Diclofenac</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac Capsules are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral diclofenac even if the milligram strength is the same. Diclofenac Capsules contain diclofenac free acid whereas other diclofenac products contain a salt of diclofenac, i.e., diclofenac potassium or sodium. A 35 mg dose of Diclofenac Capsules is approximately equal to 37.6 mg of sodium diclofenac or 39.5 mg of potassium diclofenac. Therefore, do not substitute similar dosing strengths of other diclofenac products without taking this into consideration.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac Capsules: 18 mg – blue body and light green cap (imprinted IP-203 on the body and 18 mg on the cap in white ink).</p><p>Diclofenac Capsules: 35 mg – blue body and green cap (imprinted IP-204 on the body and 35 mg on the cap in white ink).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac Capsules is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to diclofenac or any components of the drug product [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)</span>]</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)</span>]</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</span></p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of Diclofenac Capsules in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Diclofenac Capsules is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Diclofenac Capsules until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</p><p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2-6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3-8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p><p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p><p>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more then 90 days.</p><p>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with Diclofenac Capsules, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), Diclofenac Capsules should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Diclofenac Capsules immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with Diclofenac Capsules, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing Diclofenac Capsules with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, and anti-epileptics).</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</span></p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Avoid the use of Diclofenac Capsules in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Diclofenac Capsules is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Diclofenac Capsules in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of Diclofenac Capsules may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating Diclofenac Capsules. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of Diclofenac Capsules [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Avoid the use of Diclofenac Capsules in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If Diclofenac Capsules is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Diclofenac Capsules is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. When Diclofenac Capsules is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of Diclofenac Capsules at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac Capsules is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with Diclofenac Capsules has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions, such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of Diclofenac Capsules in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Patients with Acute Pain</span></p><p>Two-hundred sixteen (216) patients received Diclofenac Capsules in the completed, 48-hour, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of acute pain following bunionectomy.

Of those, 360 (60%) patients completed the trial. The most frequent adverse reactions in this study are summarized in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse reactions reported for diclofenac and other NSAIDs:</span></p><p>In patients taking other NSAIDs, the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1%-10% of patients are:</p><p>Gastrointestinal experiences including: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal) and vomiting.</p><p>Abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritus, rashes and tinnitus.</p><p>Additional adverse reactions reported occasionally include:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> fever, infection, sepsis</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular System:</span> congestive heart failure, hypertension, tachycardia, syncope</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive System:</span> dry mouth, esophagitis, gastric/peptic ulcers, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, glossitis, hematemesis, hepatitis, jaundice</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemic and Lymphatic System:</span> ecchymosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, melena, purpura, rectal bleeding, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic and Nutritional:</span> weight changes</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System:</span> anxiety, asthenia, confusion, depression, dream abnormalities, drowsiness, insomnia, malaise, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremors, vertigo</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory System:</span> asthma, dyspnea</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> alopecia, photosensitivity, sweating increased</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> blurred vision</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital System:</span> cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, oliguria/polyuria, proteinuria, renal failure</p><p>Other adverse reactions, which occur rarely are:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> anaphylactic reactions, appetite changes, death</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular System:</span> arrhythmia, hypotension, myocardial infarction, palpitations, vasculitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive System:</span> colitis, eructation, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, liver failure, liver necrosis, pancreatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemic and Lymphatic System:</span> agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic and Nutritional:</span> hyperglycemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System:</span> convulsions, coma, hallucinations, meningitis</p><p>Respiratory System: respiratory depression, pneumonia</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> conjunctivitis, hearing impairment</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">See Table 4 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.</li>
<li>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).</li>
<li>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>During concomitant use of Diclofenac Capsules and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.</li>
<li>During concomitant use of Diclofenac Capsules and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</li>
<li>When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.</li>
</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting 30 weeks gestation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Use of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Diclofenac Capsules in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, and rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses approximately 1, 1, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of Diclofenac Capsules despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>There are no studies on the effects of Diclofenac Capsules during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal data</span></p><p>Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of Diclofenac Capsules, 105 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 2 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In rats, maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Diclofenac Capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the Diclofenac Capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period).</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac Capsules, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Diclofenac Capsules in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)</span>].</p><p>Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)</span>].</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Diclofenac Capsule Description</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac Capsules are a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, available as hard gelatin capsules of 18 mg and 35 mg for oral administration. The chemical name is 2-[(2, 6-dichlorophenyl) amino] benzeneacetic acid. The molecular weight is 296.15. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">1</span>1Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span>, and it has the following chemical structure.</p><p>Diclofenac acid is a white to slight yellowish crystalline powder. Diclofenac acid has a pKa of 4.18 and a logP of 3.03. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in ethanol.</p><p>The inactive ingredients in Diclofenac Capsules include a combination of lactose monohydrate, sodium lauryl sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium and sodium stearyl fumarate. The capsule shells contain gelatin, titanium dioxide, and dyes FD&amp;C blue #1, FD&amp;C blue #2, FDA/E172 Yellow Iron Oxide and FDA/E172 Black Iron Oxide. The imprinting on the gelatin capsules is white edible ink. The 18 mg capsules have a blue body imprinted with IP-203 and light green cap imprinted with 18 mg in white ink. The 35 mg capsules have a blue body imprinted with IP-204 and green cap imprinted with 35 mg in white ink.</p><h2>Diclofenac Capsule - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of Diclofenac Capsules, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The relative bioavailability of Diclofenac Capsules 35 mg capsules was compared to diclofenac potassium immediate-release (IR) tablets 50 mg in 39 healthy subjects under fasted and fed conditions in a single-dose crossover study.</p><p>Diclofenac Capsules 35 mg capsules do not result in an equivalent systemic exposure to 50 mg diclofenac potassium IR tablets.</p><p>When taken under fasted conditions, a 20% lower dose of diclofenac in Diclofenac Capsules resulted in a 23% lower mean systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) and a 26% lower mean peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) compared to diclofenac potassium IR tablets. The time to reach peak concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was similar for Diclofenac Capsules and diclofenac potassium IR tablets and was ~1 hour for both.</p><p>When taken under fed conditions, a 20% lower dose of diclofenac in Diclofenac Capsules resulted in a 23% lower mean systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) and a 48% lower mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> compared to diclofenac potassium IR tablets. The T<span class="Sub">max</span> for Diclofenac Capsules was delayed by approximately 1 hour compared to diclofenac potassium IR tablets (3.32 hours vs. 2.33 hours, respectively).</p><p>When taken under fed conditions, Diclofenac Capsules resulted in an 11% lower mean systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) and a 60% lower mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> compared to fasted conditions. Whereas diclofenac potassium IR tablets under fed conditions resulted in 8% – 10% lower mean systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) and 28% – 43% lower mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> compared to fasted conditions, based on the results from two individual food effect studies. The T<span class="Sub">max</span> for Diclofenac Capsules was delayed by approximately 2.32 hours under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions (3.32 hours vs. 1.00 hour, respectively), while the T<span class="Sub">max</span> for diclofenac potassium IR tablets was delayed by approximately 1.00 – 1.33 hours under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions (1.70 vs. 0.74 hours and 2.33 vs. 1.00 hours, respectively in two studies).</p><p>There were no differences in elimination half-life between Diclofenac Capsules and diclofenac potassium IR tablets under fasted or fed conditions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available. After repeated oral administration, no accumulation of diclofenac in plasma occurred.</p><p>Administration of Diclofenac Capsules 18 mg and 35 mg was associated with dose proportional pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Taking Diclofenac Capsules with food causes a significant decrease in the rate but not the overall extent of systemic absorption of diclofenac compared with taking Diclofenac Capsules on an empty stomach. Diclofenac Capsules results in 60% lower C<span class="Sub">max</span>, 11% lower AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>, and 2.32 hours delayed T<span class="Sub">max</span> (1.0 hour during fasted versus 3.32 hours during fed) under the fed condition compared to the fasted condition. The effectiveness of Diclofenac Capsules when taken with food has not been studied in clinical studies. The decreased C<span class="Sub">max</span> may be associated with decreased effectiveness. Taking Diclofenac Capsules with food may cause a reduction in effectiveness compared to taking Diclofenac Capsules on an empty stomach.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac potassium is 1.3 L/kg. Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15-105 mg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</p><p>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine, and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric:</span> The pharmacokinetics of Diclofenac Capsules has not been investigated in pediatric patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Race:</span> Pharmacokinetic differences due to race/ethnicity have not been identified.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> No dedicated diclofenac pharmacokinetics studies in patients with hepatic impairment were conducted. Hepatic metabolism accounts for almost 100% of diclofenac elimination. Therefore, in patients with hepatic impairment, start with the lowest dose and if efficacy is not achieved, consider use of an alternate product [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span> Diclofenac pharmacokinetics has been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac have been detected in studies of patients with renal impairment. In patients with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60-90, 30-60, and less than 30 mL/min; N=6 in each group), AUC values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy subjects [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Aspirin:</span> When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 4 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats given diclofenac sodium up to 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of Diclofenac Capsules based on body surface area [BSA] comparison) have revealed no significant increase in tumor incidence. A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.014 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.04 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in females did not reveal any oncogenic potential.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Diclofenac sodium did not show mutagenic activity in in vitro point mutation assays in mammalian (mouse lymphoma) and microbial (yeast, Ames) test systems and was nonmutagenic in several mammalian in vitro and in vivo tests, including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Diclofenac sodium administered to male and female rats at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) did not affect fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acute Pain</span></p><p>The efficacy of Diclofenac Capsules in the management of acute pain was demonstrated in a single multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm study comparing Diclofenac Capsules 18 mg and 35 mg taken three times a day, placebo, and celecoxib in patients with pain following bunionectomy. The study enrolled 428 patients with a mean age of 40 years (range 18 to 65 years) and a minimum pain intensity rating of at least 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) during the 9-hour period after discontinuation of the anesthetic block following bunionectomy surgery. Patients were randomized equally across the treatment groups.</p><p>The mean and range (in parenthesis) of pain intensities on the VAS at baseline were 74 mm (44 to 100 mm), 77 mm (41 to 100 mm), and 76 mm (40 to 100 mm) for the Diclofenac Capsules 35 mg, Diclofenac Capsules 18 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. One tablet of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10 mg/325 mg was permitted every 4 to 6 hours as rescue medication. About 82% of patients in the Diclofenac Capsules 35 mg group, 85% of the patients in the Diclofenac Capsules 18 mg group, and 97% of patients in the placebo group took rescue medication for pain management during the study.</p><p>The average pain intensities over time are depicted for the treatment groups in Figure 1. Both Diclofenac Capsules 18 mg and 35 mg demonstrated efficacy in pain intensity reduction compared with placebo, as measured by the sum of pain intensity difference over 0 to 48 hours after the first dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 Average Pain Intensity Over 48 Hours for Diclofenac Capsules 18 mg, Diclofenac Capsules 35 mg, and Placebo Groups</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Osteoarthritis Pain</span></p><p>The efficacy of Diclofenac Capsules in the management of osteoarthritis pain was demonstrated in a single multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study comparing Diclofenac Capsules 35 mg taken twice a day or three times a day and placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The study enrolled 305 patients with a mean age of 62 (range 41 to 90 years). Osteoarthritis pain was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index Pain Subscale (WOMAC Pain Subscale). Mean baseline WOMAC Pain Subscale Score across treatment groups was 75 mm using a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale.</p><p>The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline at 12 weeks in the WOMAC Pain Subscale.
