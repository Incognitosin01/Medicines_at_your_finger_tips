Do not use it in larger amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your child's prescription label.</p><p>Your child's doctor may occasionally change the dose to make sure your child gets the best results from this medication.</p><p>iPlex is given as an injection (shot) under the skin in your child's upper arm, upper thigh, stomach area, or buttocks.
