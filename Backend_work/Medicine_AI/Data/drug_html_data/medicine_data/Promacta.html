Eltrombopag can lower the risk of bleeding by increasing platelets in your blood.</p><p>Promacta is used to prevent bleeding episodes in adults and children age 1 year and older, who have chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). ITP is a bleeding condition caused by a lack of platelets in the blood. This medicine is not a cure for ITP and it will not make your platelet counts normal if you have this condition.</p><p>Promacta is also used to prevent bleeding in adults with chronic hepatitis C who are treated with an interferon (such as Intron A, Infergen, Pegasys, PegIntron, Rebetron, Redipen, or Sylatron).</p><p>Promacta is also used together with other medications to treat severe aplastic anemia in adults and children who are at least 2 years old.</p><p>Promacta is sometimes given after other treatments have failed.</p><p>Promacta is not for use in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (also called "preleukemia").</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you take Promacta tell your doctor if you have kidney disease, blood cancer, a bone marrow disorder, high platelet levels, liver problems (if you are not being treated for hepatitis C), a history of cataracts or blood clot, if your spleen has been removed, or if you are of East Asian descent. Also tell your doctor about all other medications you use.</p><p>Take Promacta on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Do not take this medication with milk. Avoid all dairy products or products that contain calcium (including fortified fruit juice) for at least 4 hours before or after you take Promacta.</p><p>If you have chronic hepatitis C, taking Promacta with ribavirin and interferon treatment can increase your risk of liver problems. <b>Call your doctor at once if you have signs of liver problems</b>: nausea, upper stomach pain, confusion, tired feeling, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).</p><p>After you stop taking this medicine, your risk of bleeding may be even higher than it was before you started treatment. Be extra careful to avoid cuts or injury for at least 4 weeks after you stop taking this medicine. Your blood will need to be tested weekly during this time.</p><p><b>Call your doctor at once if you have signs of liver problems</b>: nausea, upper stomach pain, confusion, tired feeling, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>To make sure Promacta is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Use a new dosing syringe each time you mix the medicine, to measure the water and to give the correct dose.</p><p>You may need frequent medical tests to check your bone marrow cells or liver function. Your eyes may also need to be checked for signs of cataracts.</p><p>Eltrombopag doses are based on weight in children younger than 6 years old. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>Promacta is usually taken for 6 months. It may take up to 4 weeks before the medicine prevents major bleeding episodes.
