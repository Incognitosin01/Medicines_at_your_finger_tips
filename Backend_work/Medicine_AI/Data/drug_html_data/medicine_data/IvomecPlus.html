Now, Merial Limited combines ivermectin, the active ingredient of IVOMEC, with clorsulon, an effective adult flukicide. A single injection of Ivomec Plus (ivermectin and clorsulon) offers all the benefits of Ivomec Plus control of adult <span class="Italics">Fasciola hepatica</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">The dosage level of clorsulon supplied by Ivomec Plus is effective only against adult liver flukes (<span class="Italics">Fasciola hepatica</span>).</span></p><h2>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Ivomec Plus is a ready-to-use sterile solution containing 1% w/v ivermectin, 10% clorsulon, 40% glycerol formal, and propylene glycol, q.s. ad 100%. It is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 200 mcg ivermectin/kg and 2 mg clorsulon/kg given subcutaneously behind the shoulder at the rate of 1 mL per 110 lb (50 kg) body weight.</p><h2>MODE OF ACTION</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p>The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Clorsulon is rapidly absorbed into the circulating blood. Erythrocytes with bound drug as well as plasma are ingested by <span class="Italics">Fasciola hepatica</span>. Adult <span class="Italics">Fasciola hepatica</span> are killed by clorsulon because of inhibition of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, which is their primary source of energy.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Ivomec Plus Injection is indicated for the effective treatment and control of the following parasites of cattle:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Roundworms</span> (adults and fourth-stage larvae):<br/>

<span class="Italics">Sarcoptes scabiei</span> var. <span class="Italics">bovis</span></p><h3>Persistent Activity</h3><p class="First">Ivomec Plus Injection has been proved to effectively control infections and to protect cattle from reinfection with <span class="Italics">Dictyocaulus viviparus</span> and <span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum radiatum</span> for 28 days after treatment; <span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi</span>, <span class="Italics">Trichostrongylus axei</span> and <span class="Italics">Cooperia punctata</span> for 21 days after treatment; <span class="Italics">Haemonchus placei</span>, and <span class="Italics">Cooperia oncophora</span> for 14 days after treatment.</p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Ivomec Plus should be given only by subcutaneous injection at a dose volume of 1 mL per 110 lb (50 kg) body weight. This volume will deliver 10 mg ivermectin and 100 mg clorsulon. For example:</p><h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Ivomec Plus (ivermectin and clorsulon) Injection is to be given subcutaneously only. Animals should be appropriately restrained to achieve the proper route of administration. Use of a 16-gauge, 1/2" to 3/4" sterile needle is recommended. Inject the solution subcutaneously (under the skin) behind the shoulder (see illustration).</p><p>Any single-dose syringe or standard automatic syringe equipment may be used with the 50 mL pack size. When using the 200 mL, 500 mL or 1000 mL pack size, use only automatic syringe equipment.</p><p>Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections.</p><p>No special handling or protective clothing is necessary.</p><p>The viscosity of the product increases in cool temperatures.</p><p>Administering IVOMEC<span class="Sup">®</span> Plus at temperatures of 5°C (41°F) or below may be difficult. Users can make dosing easier by warming both the product and injection equipment to about 15°C (59°F).</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">In breeding animals (bulls and cows), ivermectin and clorsulon used at the recommended level had no effect on breeding performance.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS.<br/>
Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span></p><p>The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To report adverse effects, obtain an MSDS or for assistance, contact Merial at 1-888-637-4251.</p><h2>RESIDUE WARNING</h2><p class="First">Do not treat cattle within 49 days of slaughter. Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Transitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous administration. Soft-tissue swelling at the injection site has also been observed. These reactions have disappeared without treatment. Divide doses greater than 10 mL between two injection sites to reduce occasional discomfort or site reaction. Different injection sites should be used for other parenteral products.</p><p>Ivomec Plus Injection has been developed specifically for use in cattle only. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result.</p><p>For subcutaneous injection in cattle only.</p><p>This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use.</p><p>Restricted Drug (California) - use only as directed.</p><h3>When to Treat Cattle with Grubs</h3><p class="First">Ivomec Plus effectively controls all stages of cattle grubs. However, proper timing of treatment is important. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly (warble fly) season.</p><p>Destruction of <span class="Italics">Hypoderma larvae</span> (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions including the possibility of fatalities. Killing <span class="Italics">Hypoderma lineatum</span> when it is in the tissue surrounding the esophagus (gullet) may cause bloat; killing <span class="Italics">H. bovis</span> when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis. These reactions are not specific to treatment with Ivomec Plus, but can occur with any successful treatment of grubs. Cattle should be treated either before or after stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian concerning the proper time for treatment.</p><p>Cattle treated with Ivomec Plus after the end of the heel fly season may be retreated with ivermectin during the winter for internal parasites, mange mites or sucking lice, without danger of grub-related reactions. A planned parasite control program is recommended.</p><p>Protect product from light.</p><h3>Environmental Safety</h3><p class="First">Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with soil it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive overtime. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain aquatic organisms. Do not permit water runoff from feedlots to enter lakes, streams or ponds. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><p>As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung of treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insects that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction. The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and life-cycle specific.</p><p>When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependent insects.</p><h2>How is Ivomec Plus Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ivomec Plus Injection is available in four ready-to-use pack sizes:</p><p>The 50 mL pack is a multiple-dose, rubber-capped bottle.
