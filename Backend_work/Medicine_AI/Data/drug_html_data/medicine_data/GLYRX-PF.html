Advise patients with glaucoma to promptly seek medical care in the event that they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils).</p><h3>Drowsiness or Blurred Vision</h3><p class="First">GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF may cause drowsiness or blurred vision. Warn patients not to participate in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, or performing hazardous work, until these issues resolve.</p><h3>Heat Prostration</h3><p class="First">In the presence of fever, high environmental temperature, and/or during physical exercise, heat prostration can occur with use of anticholinergic agents including GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF (due to decreased sweating), particularly in children and the elderly. Advise patients to avoid exertion and high environmental temperature after receiving GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF.</p><h3>Intestinal Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance treatment with GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF is inappropriate and possibly harmful. Avoid use in patients with these conditions.</p><h3>Tachycardia</h3><p class="First">Investigate any tachycardia before giving GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF because an increase in the heart rate may occur. Use with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, or hyperthyroidism.</p><h3>Risk of Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Renal elimination of glycopyrrolate may be severely impaired in patients with renal failure. Dosage adjustments may be necessary in this population [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Autonomic Neuropathy, Hepatic Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Prostatic Hypertrophy, or Hiatal Hernia</h3><p class="First">Use GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF with caution in the elderly and in all patients with autonomic neuropathy, hepatic disease, ulcerative colitis, prostatic hypertrophy, or hiatal hernia, because anticholinergic drugs may aggravate these conditions. Consider dose reduction and closely monitor the elderly and patients with autonomic neuropathy, hepatic disease, ulcerative colitis, prostatic hypertrophy, or hiatal hernia.</p><h3>Delayed Gastric Emptying/Gastric Stasis</h3><p class="First">The use of anticholinergic drugs, including GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF, in the treatment of peptic ulcer may produce a delay in gastric emptying/gastric stasis. Monitor patients for symptoms such as vomiting, dyspepsia, early satiety, abdominal distention, and increased abdominal pain. Discontinue GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF treatment if these symptoms develop or worsen on treatment.</p><h3>Light Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">Patients may experience sensitivity of the eyes to light. Advise patients to protect their eyes from light after receiving GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Adverse reactions to anticholinergics include xerostomia (dry mouth); urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision and photophobia due to mydriasis (dilation of the pupil); cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; tachycardia; palpitation; decreased sweating; loss of taste; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; severe allergic reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions; hypersensitivity; urticaria, pruritus, dry skin, and other dermal manifestations; some degree of mental confusion and/or excitement, especially in elderly persons.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported from post-marketing experience with glycopyrrolate: malignant hyperthermia; cardiac arrhythmias (including bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation); cardiac arrest; hypertension; hypotension; seizures; and respiratory arrest. Post-marketing reports have included cases of heart block and QTc interval prolongation associated with the combined use of glycopyrrolate and an anticholinesterase. Injection site reactions including pruritus, edema, erythema, and pain have also been reported.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The concurrent use of GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF with other anticholinergics or medications with anticholinergic activity, such as phenothiazines, antiparkinson drugs, or tricyclic antidepressants, may intensify the antimuscarinic effects and result in an increase in anticholinergic side effects.</p><p>Concomitant administration of GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF and potassium chloride in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Limited data available with glycopyrrolate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of birth defects and miscarriage, however, most of the reported exposures occurred after the first trimester. Most of the available data are based on studies with exposures that occurred at the time of Cesarean-section delivery, and these studies have not identified an adverse effect on maternal outcomes or infant Apgar scores <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats and rabbits administered glycopyrrolate orally (rats) and intramuscularly (rabbits) during the period of organogenesis, no teratogenic effects were seen at 640-times and 10-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1 mg (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), respectively <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15−20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published, randomized, controlled trials over several decades, which compared the use of glycopyrrolate to another antimuscarinic agent in pregnant women during Cesarean section, have not identified adverse maternal or infant outcomes. In normal doses (0.004 mg/kg), glycopyrrolate does not appear to affect fetal heart rate or fetal heart rate variability to a significant degree. Concentrations of glycopyrrolate in umbilical venous and arterial blood and in the amniotic fluid are low after intramuscular administration to parturients. Therefore, glycopyrrolate does not appear to penetrate through the placental barrier in significant amounts.</p><p>There are no studies on the safety of glycopyrrolate exposure during the period of organogenesis, and therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the risk of birth defects following exposure to glycopyrrolate during pregnancy. In addition, there are no data on the risk of miscarriage following fetal exposure to glycopyrrolate.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies with glycopyrrolate were performed in rats at a dietary dose of approximately 65 mg/kg/day (exposure was approximately 640 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 1 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and rabbits at intramuscular doses of up to 0.5 mg/kg/day (exposure was approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). These studies produced no teratogenic effects to the fetus.</p><p>A preclinical study on reproductive performance of rats given glycopyrrolate resulted in a decreased rate of conception and survival at weaning.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of glycopyrrolate in either human milk or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As with other anticholinergics, glycopyrrolate may cause suppression of lactation <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breast feeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Glycopyrrolate Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Glycopyrrolate Injection or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of peptic ulcer.</p><p>Dysrhythmias associated with the use of glycopyrrolate intravenously as a premedicant or during anesthesia have been observed in pediatric patients.</p><p>Infants, patients with Down’s syndrome, and pediatric patients with spastic paralysis or brain damage may experience an increased response to anticholinergics, thus increasing the potential for side effects.</p><p>A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in pediatric patients receiving large doses of anticholinergics including GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical Studies of GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Renal elimination of glycopyrrolate may be severely impaired in patients with renal failure. Dosage adjustments may be necessary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">To combat peripheral anticholinergic effects, a quaternary ammonium anticholinesterase such as neostigmine methylsulfate (which does not cross the blood-brain barrier) may be given intravenously in increments of 0.25 mg in adults. This dosage may be repeated every five to ten minutes until anticholinergic overactivity is reversed or up to a maximum of 2.5 mg. Proportionately smaller doses should be used in pediatric patients. Indication for repetitive doses of neostigmine should be based on close monitoring of the decrease in heart rate and the return of bowel sounds.</p><p>If CNS symptoms (e.g., excitement, restlessness, convulsions, psychotic behavior) occur, physostigmine (which does cross the blood–brain barrier) may be used. Physostigmine 0.5 to 2 mg should be slowly administered intravenously and repeated as necessary up to a total of 5 mg in adults. Proportionately smaller doses should be used in pediatric patients.</p><p>To combat hypotension, administer IV fluids and/or pressor agents along with supportive care. Fever should be treated symptomatically.</p><p>Following overdosage, a curare-like action may occur, i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis. In the event of a curare-like effect on respiratory muscles, artificial respiration should be instituted and maintained until effective respiratory action returns.</p><h2>GLYRX-PF Description</h2><p class="First">GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF is a synthetic anticholinergic agent. It is intended for intramuscular or intravenous administration. Each 1 mL of GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF contains 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate, water for injection, sodium chloride as a tonicity agent, and hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as pH adjusters. GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF is preservative free.</p><p>Glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium salt with the following chemical name: (<span class="Italics">RS</span>)-[3-(<span class="Italics">SR</span>)-Hydroxy-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium bromide] α-cyclopentylmandelate. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>BrNO<span class="Sub">3</span> and the molecular weight is 398.34. Glycopyrrolate structural formula is as follows:</p><p>Glycopyrrolate occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder. It is soluble in water and alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. It is completely ionized at physiological pH values. GLYRX<span class="Sup">®</span>-PF is a clear, colorless, sterile liquid with a pH of 2.0 – 3.0. The partition coefficient of Glycopyrrolate in n-octanol/water system is 0.304 (log<span class="Sub">10</span> P = -1.52) at ambient room temperature (24°C).</p><h2>GLYRX-PF - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Glycopyrrolate, like other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases. The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily. For this reason, the occurrence of CNS-related side effects is lower, in comparison to their incidence following administration of anticholinergics which are chemically tertiary amines that can cross this barrier readily. With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The following pharmacokinetic information and conclusions were obtained from published studies that used nonspecific assay methods.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution of glycopyrrolate was estimated to be 0.42 ± 0.22 L/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The in vivo metabolism of glycopyrrolate in humans has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The mean clearance and mean t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> values were reported to be 0.54 ± 0.14 L/kg/hr and 0.83 ± 0.27 hr, respectively post IV administration. After IV administration of a 0.2 mg radiolabeled glycopyrrolate, 85% of dose recovered was recovered in urine 48 hours post dose and some of the radioactivity was also recovered in bile. After IM administration of glycopyrrolate to adults, the mean t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> value is reported to be between 0.55 to 1.25 hrs. Over 80% of IM dose administered was recovered in urine and the bile as unchanged drug and half the IM dose is excreted within 3 hrs.

The mean elimination half-life was significantly longer (46.8 minutes) than in healthy patients (18.6 minutes). The mean area-under-the-concentration-time curve (10.6 hr-μg/L), mean plasma clearance (0.43 L/hr/kg), and mean 3-hour urine excretion (0.7%) for Glycopyrrolate were also significantly different than those of controls (3.73 hr-μg/L, 1.14 L/hr/kg, and 50%, respectively). These results suggest that the elimination of glycopyrrolate is severely impaired in patients with renal failure.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential of glycopyrrolate have not been conducted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>In reproduction studies in rats, dietary administration of glycopyrrolate resulted in diminished rates of conception in a dose-related manner.
