These two medicines belong to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants.</p><p>Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination works in the treatment of ADHD to increase attention and decrease restlessness in patients who are overactive, cannot concentrate, or are easily distracted. It is used as part of a total treatment program that also includes social, educational, and psychological therapy.</p><p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription. Prescriptions cannot be refilled. A new prescription must be obtained from your doctor each time you need this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination to treat ADHD in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 3 years of age for <i>Adderall® tablets</i>, in children younger than 6 years of age for <i>Adderall XR® extended-release capsules</i>, and in children younger than 13 years of age for <i>Mydayis® extended-release capsules</i>.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Adderall® tablets</i> and <i>Adderall XR® extended-release capsules</i> have not been performed in the geriatric population.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Mydayis® extended-release capsules</i> in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
