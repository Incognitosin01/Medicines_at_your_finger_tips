</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>This medicine belongs to a group of medicines known as topical local anesthetics. Topical anesthetics are used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and minor cuts and scratches.</p><p>Topical anesthetics deaden the nerve endings in the skin. They do not cause unconsciousness as do general anesthetics used for surgery.</p><p>Most topical anesthetics are available without a prescription; however, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your medical problem.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Benzocaine may be absorbed through the skin of young children and cause unwanted effects. There is no specific information comparing use of other topical anesthetics in children with use in other age groups, but it is possible that they may also cause unwanted effects in young children. Check with your doctor before using any product that contains a topical anesthetic for a child younger than 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of topical anesthetics in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Although studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in humans, topical anesthetics have not been reported to cause problems in humans. Lidocaine has not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems in animal studies. Other topical anesthetics have not been studied in animals.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Topical anesthetics have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Infection at or near the place of application or</li>
<li>Large sores, broken skin, or severe injury at the area of applicationâ€”The chance of side effects may be increased.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p>For safe and effective use of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>Follow your doctor's instructions if this medicine was prescribed.</li>
<li>Follow the manufacturer's package directions if you are treating yourself.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise directed by your doctor, do not use this medicine on large areas, especially if the skin is broken or scraped. Also, do not use it more often than directed on the package label, or for more than a few days at a time. To do so may increase the chance of absorption through the skin and the chance of unwanted effects. This is especially important when benzocaine is used for children younger than 2 years of age.</li>
</ul><p>This medicine should be used only for problems being treated by your doctor or conditions listed in the package directions. <i>Check with your doctor before using it for other problems, especially if you think that an infection may be present</i>. This medicine should not be used to treat certain kinds of skin infections or serious problems, such as severe burns.</p><p>Read the package label very carefully to see if the product contains any alcohol. Alcohol is flammable and can catch on fire. <i>Do not use any product containing alcohol near a fire or open flame, or while smoking. Also, do not smoke after applying one of these products until it has completely dried</i>.</p><p>If you are using this medicine on your face, <i>be very careful not to get it in your eyes, mouth, or nose</i>. If you are using an aerosol or spray form of this medicine, do not spray it directly on your face. Instead, use your hand or an applicator (for example, a sterile gauze pad or a cotton swab) to apply the medicine.</p><p>For patients using <i>butamben</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Butamben may stain clothing and discolor hair. It may not be possible to remove the stains. To avoid this, do not touch your clothing or your hair while applying the medicine. Also, cover the treated area with a loose bandage after applying butamben, to protect your clothes.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>lidocaine film-forming gel</i> (e.g., DermaFlex):</p><ul>
<li>First dry the area with a clean cloth or a piece of gauze. Then apply the medicine. The medicine should dry, forming a clear film, after about 1 minute.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For benzocaine and for benzocaine and menthol combination
