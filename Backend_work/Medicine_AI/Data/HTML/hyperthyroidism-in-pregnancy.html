</ul><h2>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</h2><h2>What is hyperthyroidism?</h2><p>Hyperthyroidism is a condition that develops when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones help control body temperature, heart rate, growth, and weight.</p><h2>What causes hyperthyroidism?</h2><ul>
<li><b>An autoimmune disease</b> is an immune system problem that may make your thyroid gland produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves disease is an example of an autoimmune disease that increases thyroid hormone.</li>
<li><b>A family history of thyroid disease or autoimmune disease</b> can also increase your risk.</li>
<li><b>Certain medicines</b> , such as heart medicines used to help you heart beat normally, can cause hyperthyroidism.</li>
<li><b>Infections</b> near the thyroid gland may damage the gland.</li>
<li><b>Other thyroid problems</b> such as an enlarged or swollen thyroid, lumps caused by infections, or thyroid cancer can affect how your thyroid works.</li>
<li><b>High iodine levels</b> can cause hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland uses iodine to create thyroid hormone. The thyroid can produce too much hormone if your iodine levels are high.</li>
