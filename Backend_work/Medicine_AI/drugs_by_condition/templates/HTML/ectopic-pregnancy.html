</ul><h2>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</h2><h2>What is an ectopic pregnancy?</h2><p>Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg attaches and begins to grow outside of the uterus. The most common place for this to happen is in the fallopian tube. This is sometimes called a tubal pregnancy. The egg can also implant on the outside of the uterus, on the ovary or cervix, or in the abdomen. The egg may begin to grow, but the pregnancy cannot continue normally. Ectopic pregnancy can cause heavy bleeding and may be life-threatening.</p><h2>What increases my risk for an ectopic pregnancy?</h2><ul>
<li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or infections, such as chlamydia</li>
<li>A past ectopic pregnancy, or past fertility problems</li>
<li>Fallopian tube injury or damage</li>
<li>Getting pregnant when you have an intrauterine device (IUD)</li>
<li>Past surgery in your abdomen or on your reproductive organs</li>
<li>Medicines to treat infertility or that contain female hormones</li>
<li>Certain fertility treatments, such as multiple embryo transplant</li>
<li>Smoking cigarettes</li>
<li>Age older than 35 years</li>
</ul><h2>What are the signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy?</h2><ul>
<li>One-sided abdominal or pelvic pain and cramping</li>
<li>Vaginal bleeding or spotting that happens about 7 weeks after your missed period</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>Dizziness, weakness, or fainting</li>
<li>Tissue coming out of your vagina</li>
</ul><h2>How is ectopic pregnancy diagnosed?</h2><p>Your healthcare provider will examine you and ask about other medical conditions or surgeries you have had. The provider will ask about pregnancies, miscarriages, infertility treatments, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) you have had before. You may need any of the following:</p><ul>
<li><b>A pelvic exam</b> is used to check the size and shape of your uterus, cervix, and ovaries.</li>
<li><b>Blood and urine tests</b> will show if you are currently pregnant, or if you have infections or other problems.</li>
<li><b>Ultrasound pictures</b> may be taken of the inside of your uterus, ovaries, and abdomen. An ultrasound is usually done over your abdomen, but you may also need a vaginal ultrasound. During a vaginal ultrasound, a small tube is placed into your vagina. This can help healthcare providers see areas that may be hard to see during an abdominal ultrasound.</li>
</ul><h2>How is ectopic pregnancy treated?</h2><p>Your body may absorb the pregnancy tissues and your symptoms may decrease without any treatment. If this does not happen, you may need any of the following:</p><ul>
<li><b>Medicine called methotrexate</b> may be given to stop the pregnancy. This may be given as an injection. You may need more than one dose. It is important to follow up with your healthcare provider as directed if you receive this medicine.</li>
<li><b>Surgery</b> may be done to repair or remove tissue or ruptured fallopian tubes. Your healthcare provider will talk to you about possible kinds of surgery. Your provider will consider where the ectopic pregnancy is located and the damage it caused. Talk to your provider about your desire to have children in the future. Some kinds of surgery will prevent future pregnancy.</li>
